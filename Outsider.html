							<p>They are the humans that live in the outside world.</p>
							<p>While they come from the outside world and have different clothing, hairstyles and speech patterns, there is no clearly defined difference from the people of Gensokyo.</p>
							<p>Most of these humans are in a state of panic, but it should be natural.</p>
							<p>The knowledge they possess is far more profound than ours, and they handle tools yet unknown to us.</p>
							<p>Both the humans and youkai of Gensokyo are easily influenced by the outside world, <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Lately, a sport called &amp;quot;soccer&amp;quot; has become popular. In this manner, Gensokyo is halfway infected with the outside world.">and when they learn something new from an outsider, that will become popular for a while.</a></p>
							<p>Most outsiders that get caught by youkai either get eaten at once, or get eaten once the youkai lose interest in them.</p>
							<p>If an outsider has the luck to reach the human village, they can be returned safely to the outside world if they go to the Hakurei Shrine.</p>
							<p>However, there are also rare cases where outsiders settle into Gensokyo.</p>
							<p>Such outsiders are treasured, since they hold unique knowledge.</p>

								<li class="list-group-item"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-asterisk"></span>They immediately put a tool called a "mobile phone" to their ears, and after that are at a loss as of what to do next.</li>
								<p>Perhaps this tool emits sinister sounds.</p>
								<li class="list-group-item"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-asterisk"></span>Even if they see youkai, they will neither run nor fight.</li>
								<p>They are willing to become eaten.</p>
								<li class="list-group-item"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-asterisk"></span>In spite of this, if they see a ghost they'll run away at full speed.</li>
								<p>Even though they are less dangerous than youkai...</p>
								<li class="list-group-item"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-asterisk"></span>They hold little knowledge about the outside world.</li>
								<p>Despite using those tools, they know little of the theory and construction of them.</p>
								<p>The mobile phone is an example of this.</p>
								<p>Therefore, it is impossible to reproduce the tools of the outside world in Gensokyo. Regrettable, indeed.</p>
