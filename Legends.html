									<hr>
									<img src="./Images/Characters/Reimu Hakurei.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered">
									<hr>
									<p><b>Occupation:</b> Shrine Maiden<br>
										<b>Ability:</b> Flying in the air<br>
										<b>Residence:</b> Hakurei Shrine</p>
									<hr>
									<p>The current shrine maiden at the Hakurei Shrine, which lies on the border of Gensokyo.</p>
									<p>The Hakurei Shrine exists to watch over the Great Boundary which ensures Gensokyo's existence, <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Because they can't expect to survive on offerings.">and the shrine maidens of Hakurei resolve major incidents for a living.</a></p>
									<p>Compared to previous generations of shrine maidens, her sense of danger in addition to her training is lacking, yet her power is considerable.</p>
									<p>She's defeated multitudes of youkai with her keen intuition and her incredible good luck.</p>
									<hr>
									<h4 class="text-center">Personality</h4>
									<p>She's unusually easygoing and lacks any sense of danger. She treats everyone in the same uninterested manner, neither gentle nor stern.</p>
									<p>Perhaps as a result of that, strong youkai tend to like her, while weak youkai fear her.</p>
									<p>However, her opinion regarding youkai is that exterminating them is her job, and no amount of arguing will sway her otherwise.</p>
									<hr>
									<h4 class="text-center">Ability</h4>
									<p>She has the power to defy gravity and fly freely through the sky.</p>
									<p>Nothing is holding her up.</p>
									<p>In addition, she has the ability as the miko of Hakurei.</p>
									<p>The Hakurei shrine maidens control the Great Hakurei Boundary and protect Gensokyo.</p>
									<p>If the Great Boundary were destroyed, either from inside or out, Gensokyo would likely not fare well.</p>
									<p>Gensokyo relies on the Hakurei Shrine and its shrine maidens to continue to exist as it does today.</p>
									<p>As a result, no youkai oppose them.</p>
									<p>Due to her easygoing appearance, it's impossible to tell whether she realizes this or not, but the Hakurei shrine maidens really do have all of Gensokyo under their thumbs.</p>
									<hr>
									<h4 class="text-center">Spell Card Rules</h4>
									<p>As it would be dangerous for any youkai to defeat the Hakurei shrine maiden, many youkai felt that their existences had become meaningless.</p>
									<p>And so the spell card rules were introduced.</p>
									<p>The spell card rules allow both parties to show off their skills in a beautiful competition.</p>
									<p>The major points are:</p>
									<ul class="list-group">
										<li class="list-group-item"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-asterisk"></span>Spell cards are specially-named techniques, and they must be declared upon use.</li>
										<li class="list-group-item"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-asterisk"></span>The number of each parties' spell cards must be determined in advance of a duel.</li>
										<li class="list-group-item"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-asterisk"></span>The first party to use all of their spell cards must admit defeat.</li>
										<li class="list-group-item"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-asterisk"></span>The victor is entitled only to what was agreed upon before the duel. If they're not interested in what their opponent has to offer, they can refuse a duel.</li>
										<li class="list-group-item"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-asterisk"></span>Winners should generally allow losers a rematch.</li>
										<li class="list-group-item"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-asterisk"></span>Always prepare for the unexpected.</li>
									</ul>
									<p>Following these rules allows for conflict resolution which is almost like a sporting event.</p>
									<p>With the introduction of these rules, it became possible for even relatively weak humans to challenge youkai.</p>
									<p>At the same time, it became possible for youkai to safely defeat the shrine maiden without worrying about the consequences.</p>
									<hr>
									<h4 class="text-center">Everyday Life</h4>
									<p>When an incident is not occurring, <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="She may even be more easygoing than most people.">she is a very ordinary human.</a></p>
									<p>She lazes about the rarely-visited shrine, pretends to clean it, and drinks tea.</p>
									<p>She's often seen going out to shop in the human village.</p>
									<p>If she catches sight of a youkai on the way, she will surely teach them a lesson.</p>
									<p>In this way, she's different from a usual human.</p>
									<hr>
									<h4 class="text-center">Job</h4>
									<p>She is a specialist in incident resolution.</p>
									<p><a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="&quot;Incident&quot; means a phenomenon that affects all of Gensokyo and is of unknown cause. Typically this is due to some youkai's whimsy or the doings of a newcomer.">When an incident occurs,</a> her usual laziness vanishes, and she immediately investigates to resolve whatever matter is at hand.</p>
									<p>Although the shrine maiden of Hakurei was initially the only one who resolved incidents, these days, there are many imitators who go out to resolve incidents as well.</p>
									<hr>
									<h4 class="text-center">The Hakurei Shrine from the Outer World</h4>
									<p>Since the Hakurei Shrine stands on the boundary of Gensokyo from the outside world, one can go to the shrine from either world.</p>
									<p>But it normally isn't possible to pass between the two worlds.</p>
									<p>People from Gensokyo can go only to Gensokyo's Hakurei Shrine, and people from the outside world can go only to the outside world's Hakurei Shrine.</p>
									<p>It's said that the Hakurei Shrine seen from outside is a desolate, uninhabited shrine which no one visits.</p>
									<p>Before the Great Boundary was created, the shrine was not as empty as it is now, but it was also not built up to the same scale as the Gensokyo one.</p>
									<p>It's said that the Hakurei Shrine in the outside world has mostly been abandoned since the boundary was created.</p>

									<h4 class="text-center">Scarlet Mist Incident</h4>
									<p>The incident when all of Gensokyo was covered by a red mist, and the light of the day could not reach the ground.</p>
									<p>This incident was caused by Remilia Scarlet.</p>
									<p>She disliked the light of the sun, and covered Gensokyo in mist.</p>
									<p>At this time, it's said that Reimu went to the Scarlet Devil Mansion alone, and resolved it quite forcefully.</p>
									<p>Once the perpetrator came to light, the Scarlet Devil Mansion instantly became infamous.</p>

									<p>The incident when it continued snowing even after winter ended and spring came, and the flowers did not bloom.</p>
									<p>The details of this incident are not widely known.</p>
									<p>She heard that the perpetrator was in the Netherworld, then taught her a lesson and resolved things, somehow.</p>
									<p>Although no relationship between the Netherworld and the long winter has been proven, it's true that she noticed something most people didn't, saying "Didn't you see that cherry petals were blowing from the Netherworld?"</p>

									<p>In this incident, night lasted for an extended period of time, and dawn did not come for a while.</p>
									<p>Although she claims that she also solved this incident, if one asks her about the cause or the perpetrator, she'll only respond with ambiguous answers.</p>
									<p>It's an incident with many mysteries and no records of the details.</p>

									<h4 class="text-center">The Great Barrier Incident of Sixty Years</h4>
									<p>The Great Barrier is composed of many smaller boundaries, both illusionary and not, but every sixty years it undergoes a period of weakening.</p>
									<p>Recently, the second period of this cycle occurred, and a number of smaller incidents sprang up around Gensokyo.</p>
									<p>This is the sort of incident that would resolve itself somehow if left alone, but it seems that she was ignorant of this fact and set out to solve it as usual.</p>
									<div class="row">
										<div class="col-md-4"></div>
										<div class="col-md-4"><hr></div>
										<div class="col-md-4"></div>
									</div>
									<h4 class="text-center">The Vampire Incident</h4>
									<p>Originally, attacking humans was the point of the youkai's existence, but since the erection of the Great Barrier it's become difficult for them to do so, and they've had to find sources of food outside their normal choices. Consequently, the collective willpower of the youkai began to fall.</p>
									<p>It was into this situation that a powerful youkai from outside, a vampire, appeared, and quickly amassed a great number of subordinates.</p>
									<p>In the end, the vampire was defeated through the efforts of the most powerful youkai, and a settlement was reached through a contract that placed a number of prohibitions on the vampire's activities.</p>
									<p>Some of the more willful youkai found these terms distasteful and entered into discussions with the Hakurei shrine maiden.</p>
									<p>The shrine maiden, who was also tiring of an uneventful lifestyle, agreed to the youkai point of view that some battles were necessary.</p>
									<p><a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="It appears various other rules were also considered, but as the beauty and volume of danmaku especially appealed to youkai and women, they aren't as popular.">The result of this were the spell card rules, which allowed duelists to seemingly stake their lives in individual combat.</a></p>
									<p>It's said that the raucous Scarlet Mist incident caused by that vampire was the first time the spell card rules were put to use.</p>
									<p>Since then, various incidents have occurred with moderate frequency that have had no lasting effects.</p>
									<p>The game ends once a victor is decided, although the shrine maiden likes to have rematches until she wins.</p>

									<h3 class="text-center">Marisa Kirisame<br><small>Ordinary Magician</small></h3>
									<hr>
									<img src="./Images/Characters/Marisa Kirisame.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered">
									<hr>
									<p><b>Occupation:</b> Magician<br>
										<b>Ability:</b> Use of magic<br>
										<b>Residence:</b> Forest of Magic</p>
									<hr>
									<p>A very unusual magician who lives in the Forest of Magic.</p>
									<p>More specifically, magician is her occupation, but she is human.</p>
									<p>She's clad in mostly black clothes, wears an enormous black hat and is often seen going to the shrine.</p>
									<p>She usually doesn't appear much in the human village.</p>
									<p>She is the only daughter of the proprietor of the successful Kirisame second-hand shop in the village, <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="As this is a private matter the details are unclear, but it may be related to the fact that the Kirisame family doesn't deal in magical items.">but it appears she's cut off all relations there.</a></p>
									<p>The forest isn't her only home; she also runs a general store, the "Kirisame Magic Shop".</p>
									<p>However, due to the difficulty of finding the store in the forest, and the fact that nobody has any idea what she really deals with in the first place, she has rarely been seen actually working.</p>
									<p>Her personality is condescending as if trying to make fools of others, and tends to have difficulty expressing sympathy towards others, but she can be refined, and it is interesting to be with her.</p>
									<hr>
									<h4 class="text-center">Ability</h4>
									<p>She has the ability to use magic.</p>
									<p>Her specialty is magics that are mostly concerned with light and heat.</p>
									<p>She likes to say, "It ain't magic if it ain't flashy. Danmaku's all about firepower."</p>
									<p>The magic she uses does appear flashy, but their source is relatively simple.</p>
									<p>First, she has to hunt for magical mushrooms to use as the fuel, which only grow in the wild.</p>
									<p>Next, she has a peculiar way of preparing them that involves boiling them for several days in a concentrated soup.</p>
									<p>She'll create blends of many kinds of soups and dry them into a solid mass over the course of a few more days.</p>
									<p>At that point they're ready for magical experimentation.</p>
									<p>She will run all sorts of experiments, including throwing the masses, heating them or submerging them in mountain stream water.</p>
									<p>Very rarely, she'll discover a truly magical reaction in the course of these experiments.</p>
									<p>She'll record both failures and successes in her records, and then begin gathering mushrooms once again.</p>
									<p>Her magic is extremely flashy, and indeed quite beautiful, but it's backed up by a considerable amount of nothing but her own effort, which she goes to great lengths never to show others.</p>
									<p>In other words, it's not unlike a gigantic fireworks show.</p>
									<p><a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="It's possible that in the future she may become a (youkai) magician.">Still, it's quite unusual for a human to be able to use magic to this extent.</a></p>
									<p>She says this is also due to the effects of the Forest of Magic.</p>
									<hr>
									<h4 class="text-center">Kirisame Magic Shop</h4>
									<p>Her current occupation.</p>
									<p>Or so she says, but she's almost never been seen actually working.</p>
									<p>The shop is located at her house, but not only do you have to make your way safely through the Forest of Magic to get there, you must do so while she's actually home.</p>
									<p>It is as if she doesn't seem to be concerned at all with conducting business.</p>
									<p>Furthermore, the shop's interior is disorganized beyond imagination, almost as if it's a miniature Forest of Magic in itself.</p>
									<p>She undertakes a wide variety of work, ranging from making gambling predictions to the resolution of serious incidents.</p>
									<p>However, if you want to see her use magic, requesting her to put on a summer fireworks display might be a good idea.</p>
									<p>Since she typically accepts payment on success, she won't take any money at all in the case of failure, which is surprisingly forthright of her.</p>
									<hr>
									<h4 class="text-center">Her Magic</h4>
									<p>She says she does any kind of magic, but that doesn't mean she can actually use a variety of different spells.</p>
									<p>Her magical skills are generally limited to destruction, so there isn't much she can do besides youkai extermination.</p>
									<p>However, her powers generally have few weaknesses, and have the same effect regardless of their target, be they human or youkai, <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Among humans.">so there are few who can match her in terms of sheer destructive power.</a></p>
									<p>As she usually spends a lot of time at the shrine, whenever someone requests that the Hakurei shrine maiden take care of a youkai, she often decides to do it herself.</p>
									<p>Due to her considerable skill as a youkai hunter and especially since the establishment of the spell card rules, she will shamelessly flaunt her showy magic abilities every chance she gets.</p>
									<p>Since she seems to act in competition to the shrine maiden, they help improve the other.</p>
									<hr>
									<h4 class="text-center">Occupation As A Thief</h4>
									<p>Her other occupation is as a common burglar.</p>
									<p>She seems to be more enthusiastic about that than being a jack-of-all-trades.</p>
									<p>Her motto is, she fair-and-square breaks into the front, and fair-and-square says "I'll borrow ze" while carrying it off.</p>
									<p>She especially seems to feel little guilt in carrying off books, though they damage easily.</p>
									<p>The Gensokyo Chronicles of the Hieda family have not, as yet, incurred damage, but it would be dangerous if the existence of this collection were to become public knowledge.</p>
									<hr>
									<h4 class="text-center">Tools</h4>
									<p>Magic users occasionally use tools.</p>
									<p>The tools this particular magician uses include a magic broom, a miniature furnace, and handmade grimoires.</p>
									<p>She uses the magic broom to ride around on because she believes it's an essential tool for a magician.</p>
									<p>It was originally a normal broom for cleaning, but it was affected by her constant use of it in magical rituals and began an unusual growth of its own.</p>
									<p>Leaves appear to be sprouting from the handle, even though it is already dead.</p>
									<p>This is unrelated to her magic.</p>
									<p>The furnace is her strongest weapon, and manages to hold up through strenuous use in magical experiments and cooking.</p>
									<p>It's a miniaturized source of immense firepower, the only one of its kind in Gensokyo.</p>
									<p>It fuels her magic power and she is able to control it at will, from gentle flames for simmering pots overnight to fire powerful enough to cause bushfires.</p>
									<p>However, it's not an item of her making, but was created by Kourindo.</p>
									<p>The grimoires are a careful recording of the results of all of her magical experiments, regardless of their outcome.</p>
									<p>They're grimoires in name only, simply a record of her actions.</p>
									<p>She probably believes that magicians need to have books.</p>
									<p>In addition, <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="It's probably dangerous to hide things that explode when thrown.">she seems to have various other small implements that are hidden away in her skirt or her hat.</a></p>

									<h3 class="text-center">Sakuya Izayoi<br><small>Scarlet Devil Mansion Maid</small></h3>
									<hr>
									<img src="./Images/Characters/Sakuya Izayoi.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered">
									<hr>
									<p><b>Occupation:</b> Maid<br>
										<b>Ability:</b> Manipulation of Time<br>
										<b>Residence:</b> Scarlet Devil Mansion</p>
									<hr>
									<p>The live-in maid at the Scarlet Devil Mansion.</p>
									<p>The only human who lives in the house where devils dwell and leader of the maids.</p>
									<p>A mysterious girl who works in a place that normal humans don't dare approach.</p>
									<p>Nobody had ever seen her before she started working at the mansion.</p>
									<p>Furthermore, she is ever an ally of youkai, and is cold-hearted towards human villagers who visit the mansion.</p>
									<p>This suggests that she might not be a human from Gensokyo, but rather one from the outside or a completely different world.</p>
									<p>As she has no close relations with anyone in the human village, she is still shrouded in mystery.</p>
									<p>She does come to the village to shop though, carrying a refined atmosphere around herself. <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Though she appears to act outright hostile while at the Scarlet Devil Mansion, this is likely because she is acting in her capacity as security for the mansion.">She is never seen showing hostility towards other humans on such occasions.</a></p>
									<hr>
									<h4 class="text-center">Ability</h4>
									<p>She has the ability to manipulate time.</p>
									<p>It is among the strongest of abilities for a human to possess, and is not something that can be learned through training.</p>
									<p>Manipulating time allows one to stop the flow of time and let only oneself move, to slow the flow of time and let oneself move at incredible speeds, or increase the flow of time and change apple juice to apple cider.</p>
									<p>However, it is generally rather difficult to revert things that have already happened.</p>
									<p>Things that have been destroyed, burnt down, eaten, etc. can not be returned to normal even if time is reversed.</p>
									<p>Reversing time only has an effect to the extent that things that have been moved return to their original position.</p>
									<p>Effectively, you can say there is no reversing time.</p>
									<p>In addition, her ability can be used to manipulate space, as well.</p>
									<p>Slowing down time also means to contract space, and hastening means to expand it.</p>
									<p>She uses this marvelous ability to perform a great many tasks such as cleaning, laundry and cooking.</p>
									<p>Besides that ability, she is skilled in knife throwing and conjuration.</p>
									<p>It's said she can pierce an apple on the head of a fairy maid 20 ken far above her in the sky.</p>
									<p>With her tricks, <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Please refrain from making tasteless comments like, &quot;That's because she can stop time.&quot;">she makes things appear in her hand which should have held nothing.</a></p>
									<hr>
									<h4 class="text-center">The Maids of the Scarlet Devil Mansion</h4>
									<p>The Scarlet Devil Mansion's policy regarding maids is quantity over quality, and they are somehow able to accomodate all of the fairy maids in their employ.</p>
									<p>She is the only human maid among them, and as the head maid she gives orders to the fairy maids.</p>
									<p>The fairy maids are mostly useless.</p>
									<p><a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Their existence doesn't really matter. The reality is that the head maid does most of the jobs.">They are sufficiently occupied in cleaning their own uniforms and making their own food.</a></p>
									<p>About the only thing worth saying about these maids is that they basically have no pay or vacation, but they receive food and tea, and can do whatever else they please.</p>
									<p>They are free to leave and regain their posts, as well.</p>
									<p>The fairy maids' lives are comparatively comfortable, and if they can come to enjoy their masters' occasional impossible requests, almost none choose to run away.</p>
									<p>In contrast, the chief maid's job is severe.</p>
									<p>As her duties include cleaning the labyrinthine interior of the mansion, taking care of its selfish master, managing the useless maids, going out to buy supplies in the human village and making pointlessly gorgeous meals, she has no time to rest.</p>
									<p>It would be impossible to do all this work alone without being able to stop time.</p>
									<hr>
									<h4 class="text-center">Her True Face</h4>
									<p>Since the maids at the Scarlet Devil Mansion receive no time off, they have no private life. Thus, her character is not well known.</p>
									<p>It is unknown why she works in the house where devils dwell, and why the vampires trust her.</p>
									<p>It appears that she is not being forced to work by the vampires.</p>
									<p>She even seems to possess a certain degree of power in the Scarlet Devil Mansion, and can sometimes give orders to the vampires.</p>
									<p>It's still unknown whether the vampires sought out the services of her extraordinary powers, or whether she herself asked for the position of head maid at the Scarlet Devil Mansion.</p>
									<p>In addition, it is said that the name she bears now was given to her by the vampires, and is not her true name.</p>
									<p>According to one theory, she was a vampire hunter from the outside world or <a class="text-info" data-toggle="For example, the netherworld, Higan, or the moon capital.">another world,</a> and followed the vampires into the Scarlet Devil Mansion to try to slay them, but was defeated instead.</p>
									<p>The reasoning behind this theory is that the silver knives she wields are those used for slaying vampires, and also because of the abilities the vampires possess.</p>
									<p>She had left for a remote location to train in slaying vampires.</p>
									<p>While she was skilled in defeating smaller demons, she had never tried her hands on a vampire.</p>
									<p>However, she had great confidence in her powers, and thought she would be able to defeat a weakened vampire easily herself, and, setting out on a journey to slay vampires.</p>
									<p>Then once she reached the Scarlet Devil Mansion, she saw the vampire there who looked so young but was surprisingly strong, and was easily defeated instead.</p>
									<p>The vampire, wanting Sakuya's power for herself, <a class="text-info" data-toggle="From name analysis fortune telling.">spared her and gave her a new name, which also gave her a completely opposite fate.</a></p>
									<p>From that point on she immediately became the vampires' servant, and since she had strong abilities, she was able to reach the position of head maid and even take a right-hand position alongside the vampires.</p>
									<p>Later, the Scarlet Devil Mansion relocated to Gensokyo, <a class="text-info" data-toggle="She already had made a strange contract with the vampires. Please see the section on vampires for more information.">but she felt it clashed with the odd environment here,</a> so at first she resisted against the vampires and the humans of Gensokyo.</p>
									<p>However, upon seeing the vampire whom she could not defeat easily beaten by a human from Gensokyo, and that they both got along as if nothing had ever happened afterwards, she slowly began to open herself towards those around her.</p>
									<p>Nowadays, it seems that something has broken through her facade, and while she still allies herself with the vampires, she has been more proactive in encountering humans.</p>
									<p>However, it's possible that the vampire who manipulates fate planned for everything to be this way from the beginning.</p>
									<p>What do you think of that theory?</p>
									<p>Also there are many theories such as ones suggesting she is actually a Homunculus, a zombie or simply just an eccentric, but the most widely believed theory is the vampire hunter theory detailed above.</p>
									<p>She claims to be in her late teens, but this is unlikely judging by her refined manner and the level of her abilities. <a class="text-info" data-toggle="Since she is also able to manipulate time.">Rather, she seems to be a human who has been living for hundreds of years.</a></p>

									<p>Even though his lifespan is longer than those of normal humans, he is not very strong due to lack of training.</p>
									<p>He previously worked at the antique store owned by the Kirisames, but he started a store on his own, believing that in order to make the most of his ability, he needed to deal with ones that nobody knew how to use, not just common goods.</p>
									<p>Items that nobody knew how to use, meaning items from the outside world.</p>
									<p>Although he is very knowledgeable, he is prone to pondering by himself and not leaving the shop, as well as being cold even towards customers.</p>
									<p>Not a suitable attitude for conducting business.</p>
									<hr>
									<h4 class="text-center">Ability</h4>
									<p>He has the ability to perceive the name and purpose of an item.</p>
									<p>Even if it is an object he has never seen before, just by looking at it, its name comes to his mind, and just by saying this name, he can imagine what the object's purpose is.</p>
									<p>Although this is an extremely suitable ability for an antique dealer, it does have one fatal weakness.</p>
									<p>He is unable to determine how to use an item.</p>
									<p>Because of that, <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="There are too many outside world tools you can't figure how to use by intuition alone.">you must find out for yourself how to use of most items obtained at Kourindo.</a></p>
									<p>But even so, there are some objects whose operation can be understood and performed.</p>
									<p>By using those, it is possible to benefit from the superior technology of the outside world, but he refuses to sell most of the usable items.</p>
									<p>Basically, he is the only one benefitting from the technology of the outside world.</p>
									<p>Even though there's hardly a shop owner more unsuited to business, Kourindo is still the only shop that deals with items from the outside world, and because of this, it has its regular customers.</p>
									<hr>
									<h4 class="text-center">Kourindo</h4>
									<p>Just beside the Forest of Magic, there is a disheveled and unsightly foreign-style building.</p>
									<p>That is Kourindo.</p>
									<p>Rather than daily necessities, this shop deals in tools from the outside world, youkai items and netherworld articles.</p>
									<p>At Kourindo, neither humans nor youkai are ever refused, so anyone can visit.</p>
									<p>A great number of items are arranged haphazardly within the store, only comparable to a warehouse.</p>
									<p>Since no-one knows for what any of the items are used, if something interests you, all you can do is inquire the shop owner about it.</p>
									<p>There are no prices listed and no way to know the market value so caveat emptor.</p>
									<p>There is a large storeroom behind the store, and most of the items lying there are not for sale.</p>
									<p>Refusing to sell anything he finds useful or interesting makes one wonder <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="He has none.">if he really has any business spirit at all,</a> one of the features of Kourindo and its owner.</p>

									<hr>
									<img src="./Images/Characters/Eirin Yagokoro.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered">
									<hr>
									<p><b>Occupation:</b> Pharmacist<br>
										<b>Ability:</b> The ability to create any kind of medicine<br>
										<b>Residence:</b> Eientei</p>
									<hr>
									<p><a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="For a fee. She doesn't make the deliveries herself, the youkai rabbits do.">She is a master pharmacist that prepares medicine at the Eientei, and sells it</a> to both human and youkai.</p>
									<p>She has only recently started this business.</p>
									<p>Her medicines are divided into consigned and direct sale varieties. Consignment operates by distributing medicine boxes to each household, and at the turn of the season the usage is checked. Only the price of the consumed medicine is then charged.</p>
									<p>Those are medicines to heal light injuries, colds, etc.</p>
									<p>Direct sale medicines are purchased in-person at Eientei. There are ones such as short-lasting medicines, medicines for serious illnesses and medicines for special cases.</p>
									<p>Her medicines have a reputation of working efficiently and without side-effects.</p>
									<p>However, there is but a single warning. Medicines for youkai and for humans are very different.</p>
									<p>Medicine for youkai are too strong for humans and they will suffer from side-effects.</p>
									<p>On the other hand, medicines for humans are poisonous to youkai.</p>
									<p>Also, if you go to Eientei, she can examine you just as a doctor would.</p>
									<p><a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="But then again, even if you go into the Bamboo Forest of the Lost, there is no guarantee that you'll reach Eientei.">It's said that she can provide medicine even for unidentifiable diseases.</a></p>
									<hr>
									<h4 class="text-center">Personality</h4>
									<p>She is not overly concerned with payment her services.</p>
									<p>Her medicines are not only very effective, but carry a fair price. And even if you can't pay immediately, she will wait however long it takes for the payment.</p>
									<p>Even if if you suddenly fall ill while poor, she will kindly examine you.</p>
									<p>And this is for both human and youkai.</p>
									<p>The fact that she has appeared all of a sudden and started treating people's illnesses, and yet doesn't seem to be motivated by money, gives an impression that there's something else to her behavior.</p>
									<p>She seems like a kind human at first impression, but since the reasons for her kindness are unknown, she sometimes makes people uneasy.</p>
									<p>She is a model person.</p>
									<p>But nothing is for free.</p>
									<hr>
									<h4 class="text-center">Her Mysteries</h4>
									<p>There are a lot of mysteries about Eientei, but she is the most mysterious part of it.</p>
									<p>Where did she gain her knowledge about medicine? Why can she make medicine for youkai as well? What was she doing before opening her pharmacy business? And many more yet unanswered questions.</p>
									<p>Her age is also unknown. Although she looks young at a first glance, her manner of speaking and behavior are characteristic of someone who has lived a long time, which only makes the question harder to ask.</p>
									<p>And especially strange is that, even though she possesses extensive knowledge, she is lacking of more general common sense.</p>
									<p>If you ask her about this, <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Full of collagen.">she'll answer with an incoherent response like that her skin looks so smooth because she made a rejuvenating medicine</a>, and won't talk any more about it.</p>
									<p>Rumor has it that she is a human with a deep connection to the Lunar Capital.</p>
									<p>The fact that there are a lot of events and people associated with the moon at Eientei, and that rabbits are the ones that distribute the medicine seem to give support to this rumor.</p>
									<p>It wouldn't be strange if her advanced medicinal practice was the moon's medicinal science itself.</p>
									<p>There's a possibility that, through some way, she has obtained the technology from the Lunar Capital.</p>

									<hr>
									<img src="./Images/Characters/Kaguya Houraisan.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered">
									<hr>
									<p><b>Occupation:</b> Unknown<br>
										<b>Ability:</b> Manipulation of eternity and the instantaneous<br>
										<b>Residence:</b> Eientei</p>
									<hr>
									<p>The princess of Eientei.</p>
									<p>Even her current activities are unknown.</p>
									<p>Eientei is a mysterious place which keeps lots of rabbits, even youkai rabbits, but it seems that she is its mistress.</p>
									<p>Lately Ms. Yagokoro has started selling medicine there, but until then nobody even knew of its existence.</p>
									<p>What have they been doing until now? What is the significance of this mysterious woman's organization? And the like. The mysteries surrounding Eientei only continue to intensify.</p>
									<p>However, as the mansion has recently begun to host events and the inhabitants are beginning to appear in the human village, the opportunities to meet the proprietor of Eientei are increasing.</p>
									<p><a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Though her manner of speech is quite dated.">The princess of Eientei is surprisingly refined in the art of conversation</a>, and will engage listeners in a variety of old tales.</p>
									<p>Perhaps the blind biwa-playing monks of old were related to her somehow.</p>
									<hr>
									<h4 class="text-center">Ability</h4>
									<p>She possesses the ability to manipulate eternity and the instantaneous.</p>
									<p>As eternity refers to a world with no history, it is also a world where change is eternally unknown.</p>
									<p>No matter how much you may try to bring about change in such a world, it is futile in a world where time has essentially stopped.</p>
									<p>It is believe that even the fact that Eientei suddenly appeared in human history and began to experience the passage of time was because she undid the effects of her eternity magic.</p>
									<p>Under the effects of that magic, <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Even its name "House of Eternity" implies this.">Eientei would probably have never appeared in the human world, but would have always remained hidden in the Bamboo Forest of the Lost.</a></p>
									<p>However, a perpetual world denies any sort of change.</p>
									<p>She may have lived for a very long time without having changed at all.</p>
									<p>Her other ability regarding the instantaneous is complementary to her manipulation of eternity, and allows control over extremely short time durations.</p>
									<p>It allows her to act in instants so short as to be imperceptible to human beings.</p>
									<p>Since time itself is just the aggregate of instants, they pass normally as time, but these instants cannot be perceived by humans.</p>
									<p>In using these times, it's said that she can have several parallel timelines.</p>
									<p>As both of these abilities are abilities to manipulate time, they far surpass what normal humans are capable of.</p>
									<hr>
									<h4 class="text-center">The Lunar Capital Exposition: "Creations of the Lunar Capital"</h4>
									<p>The exposition was an event where Eientei opened itself to the public to display various Lunar goods and informational exhibits, giving the public a chance to find out about the manor and the moon.</p>
									<p>Relations between Gensokyo and the Moon ceased long ago.</p>
									<p>The exposition was a great success among both humans seeing the subjects of the exhibits for the first time and among youkai who came to reminisce about the past.</p>
									<p>Due to the nobles of the Lunar Capital being hesitant to communicate with the beings of Earth, and it was a long time since so much discussion had occurred.</p>
									<p>The sudden opening of the exhibition sent a shock through Gensokyo, and there were few whose interest it didn't capture.</p>
									<p>Most of the displays at the exhibition could be divided into three categories.</p>
									<p>The first is the classic category of amazing items, such as carriages that fly through the sky, garments that make the body light enough to float through the air, the rabbits' mortars, etc.</p>
									<p>These exhibits make it possible to imagine the lives of the nobles living in the capital of the moon.</p>
									<p>The next group, the military category, provided a stark contrast to the classics category: a vulcan cannon light enough to wield with one hand, an ultra-small Planck bomb, a roving tank designed for lunar exploration, and other modern weapons.</p>
									<p>This gave viewers a glimpse at the incredibly advanced technology of the Lunar Capital.</p>
									<p>The final group was the academic category, which consisted of exhibits of materials: the books of lunar history, divine medicine, mathematical philosophy, mad grimoires, etc.</p>
									<p>Even though the books were written on paper, they still used advanced technology: the pictures moved, solid forms would pop out of the pages, and unfamiliar words in the text would be explained in incredible detail if you simply touched them.</p>
									<p>Unfortunately, they were all written in the Lunarian language, and alas, completely incomprehensible.</p>
									<p>As the exhibition was extremely popular, the proprietress announced her intention to hold it yearly.</p>
									<p>It appears that they're preparing some sort of stage in order to hold a performance next time.</p>

									<h3 class="text-center">Fujiwara no Mokou<br><small>The Crimson Watchguard</small></h3>
									<hr>
									<img src="./Images/Characters/Fujiwara no Mokou.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered">
									<hr>
									<p><b>Occupation:</b> Unknown<br>
										<b>Ability:</b> Ability of not dying<br>
										<b>Residence:</b> Somewhere in the Bamboo Forest of the Lost</p>
									<hr>
									<p>There's a special legend about the Bamboo Forest of the Lost.</p>
									<p><a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="They're often thought of as a group of ninja.">It's said that a group of specialized youkai exterminators, separate from the villagers, lived hidden there, with the ability to move quickly, yet silently, and use various kinds of sorcery like youkai, and went after and exterminated particularly strong and dangerous youkai, though their existence has been questioned recently.</a></p>
									<p>However, with the recent discovery of Eientei in the Bamboo Forest of the Lost, the possibility of such a group's existence seems more plausible.</p>
									<p>About that time, I encountered a person who is probably a descendant of such a group.</p>
									<p>That person is Fujiwara no Mokou.</p>
									<p>She is human, but they say she never ages and cannot be destroyed. Because she has lived for so long, she has learned various kinds of sorcery, and can be said to be on equal footing with youkai.</p>
									<p>Because she's human she exterminates youkai, she won't attack without reason, and primarily rescues lost humans from the youkai.</p>
									<p>It's said she doesn't mingle with youkai or the humans from the village, but primarily lives hidden in the Bamboo Forest of the Lost.</p>
									<p>When asked about her connection to the legendary exterminators, she feigns ignorance.</p>
									<p>She doesn't seem to concern herself much with humans, and leaves without saying a word even when she rescues lost people.</p>
									<hr>
									<h4 class="text-center">Ability</h4>
									<p>She possesses a body that doesn't age and cannot be destroyed.</p>
									<p>She is a so-called immortal.</p>
									<p><a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="It's said she could regenerate if even a single hair remains.">Her body heals unusually quickly, and even severe injuries will be completely healed in a matter of days.</a></p>
									<p>However, as she still feels the pain of her injuries it is called the melancholy of immortality.</p>
									<p>It's said that humans can only achieve immortality by becoming a celestial, but somehow she has managed to become immortal through other means.</p>
									<p>She seems to appear before others more often recently, but it's unknown as to why.</p>
									<p>She never speaks even when posed this question, so it remains a mystery.</p>
									<hr>
									<h4 class="text-center">Watchguard</h4>
									<p>At this point, she seems to have come into some sort of agreement with the villagers, and will serve as an escort through the bamboo forest to anyone who asks.</p>
									<p>She can be relied on to lead villagers to Eientei such as in the case of sudden illness.</p>
									<p>She will lead you to Eientei without fear of being lost or accosted by youkai.</p>
									<p>During that time, <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="All she says is, &quot;I'm a health nut that runs a yakitori stand.&quot;">she'll remain fairly reticent</a> about herself, but she seems to be happy to listen to others talk about their own affairs.</p>
									<p>She may be immortal, but since she's not a celestial, her way of thinking is similar to most humans.</p>
									<p>We may be able to learn more as she becomes more accustomed to speaking with others.</p>
