									<p><b>Usual threat level:</b> Very High<br>

										<b>Places likely to be encountered:</b> Anywhere<br>

									<h4 class="text-center">Characteristics</h4>
									<p>Of the newer youkai that have emerged only within the last few centuries, vampires are among the strongest of them, <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="The others consist of individual youkai, youkai living in the mountains (tengu, kappa and such), humans and animals.">strong enough to take part in the power-balance of Gensokyo</a> by now.</p>
									<p>During the day they spend their time in their mansion, and once night comes they become active; they are the Lords of the Night.</p>
									<p>Their main diet consists of the blood of humans. Those whose blood has been sucked by one will neither die nor become a ghost. They will turn into a zombie for a while before evaporating under the sunlight.</p>
									<p>They went on a rampage when they first appeared in Gensokyo, lost against powerful youkai, and settled down <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="A devil's contract is absolute, thus one can never betray it.">after agreeing to a contract.</a></p>
									<p>The details of this contract are that the youkai will offer them <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="It is said these are humans from the outside world or those whose deaths are of no consequence (suicidal, etc.).">humans from which to feed</a>; in return, the vampires will not attack humans living in Gensokyo.</p>
									<p>Of course, the contract remains in effect to this day.</p>
									<p>Vampires have tremendous physical abilities and magical power: they are able to uproot a thousand-year-old tree single-handedly, to run through the human village within the blink of an eye, to summon many devils with a single word, to turn into bats or even mist to intrude anywhere they please, and they can recover within a single night even when their body is blown away, so long as their head is intact.</p>
									<p>Some youkai have abilities to this level of power, but only vampires are known to possess all of them.</p>
									<p>Because of this, they have charisma of the highest class.</p>
									<p>However, due to their extraordinary abilities, they have many weaknesses.</p>
									<p>First, they are weak against sunlight, so they are docile during the day.</p>
									<p>Neither can they move through flowing water, so they are docile on rainy days. They also cannot cross rivers.</p>
									<p>They can't approach a sardine head or a broken holly branch.</p>
									<p>Their skin will be burnt if someone throws <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="However, they seem to like fermented soybeans.">roasted soybeans</a> at them.</p>
									<hr>
									<h3 class="text-center">Potential Harm<br><small>Disaster</small></h3>
									<p>Those as powerful as vampires are usually forbidden to directly assault humans.</p>
									<p>So, they aren't so dangerous even if you happen to meet one.</p>
									<p>Instead, they cause many disasters that affect the whole of Gensokyo.</p>
									<p>They can create abnormalities in everything including natural phenomena with no warning, for selfish reasons, which will always lead to endangering human life no matter what is affected.</p>
									<p>Most of these reasons are out of mere curiosity, and they will cease once they tire of it.</p>
									<hr>
									<h4 class="text-center">Countermeasures</h4>
									<p>Once a disaster has occurred, there is no choice but to seek help from a specialist who has the power to resolve it.</p>
									<p>The only thing an average human can do is find a way to survive.</p>
									<p>Aside from these times, vampires are relatively polite.</p>
									<p>They are usually not a threat.</p>
									<p>But that doesn't mean you should anger them.</p>
									<p>You shouldn't do something that strikes one of their weaknesses, even by accident.</p>
									<p>A halfhearted attack will only result in enraging them.</p>
									<p>In order not to unintentionally offend them, it's necessary to have a thorough knowledge of their weaknesses.</p>
