									<h4 class="text-center">Characteristics</h4>
									<p>Of the newer youkai that have emerged only within the last few centuries, vampires are among the strongest of them, <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="The others consist of individual youkai, youkai living in the mountains (tengu, kappa and such), humans and animals.">strong enough to take part in the power-balance of Gensokyo</a> by now.</p>
									<p>During the day they spend their time in their mansion, and once night comes they become active; they are the Lords of the Night.</p>
									<p>Their main diet consists of the blood of humans. Those whose blood has been sucked by one will neither die nor become a ghost. They will turn into a zombie for a while before evaporating under the sunlight.</p>
									<p>They went on a rampage when they first appeared in Gensokyo, lost against powerful youkai, and settled down <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="A devil's contract is absolute, thus one can never betray it.">after agreeing to a contract.</a></p>
									<p>The details of this contract are that the youkai will offer them <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="It is said these are humans from the outside world or those whose deaths are of no consequence (suicidal, etc.).">humans from which to feed</a>; in return, the vampires will not attack humans living in Gensokyo.</p>
									<p>Of course, the contract remains in effect to this day.</p>
									<p>Vampires have tremendous physical abilities and magical power: they are able to uproot a thousand-year-old tree single-handedly, to run through the human village within the blink of an eye, to summon many devils with a single word, to turn into bats or even mist to intrude anywhere they please, and they can recover within a single night even when their body is blown away, so long as their head is intact.</p>
									<p>Some youkai have abilities to this level of power, but only vampires are known to possess all of them.</p>
									<p>Because of this, they have charisma of the highest class.</p>
									<p>However, due to their extraordinary abilities, they have many weaknesses.</p>
									<p>First, they are weak against sunlight, so they are docile during the day.</p>
									<p>Neither can they move through flowing water, so they are docile on rainy days. They also cannot cross rivers.</p>
									<p>They can't approach a sardine head or a broken holly branch.</p>
									<p>Their skin will be burnt if someone throws <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="However, they seem to like fermented soybeans.">roasted soybeans</a> at them.</p>
									<hr>
									<h3 class="text-center">Potential Harm<br><small>Disaster</small></h3>
									<p>Those as powerful as vampires are usually forbidden to directly assault humans.</p>
									<p>So, they aren't so dangerous even if you happen to meet one.</p>
									<p>Instead, they cause many disasters that affect the whole of Gensokyo.</p>
									<p>They can create abnormalities in everything including natural phenomena with no warning, for selfish reasons, which will always lead to endangering human life no matter what is affected.</p>
									<p>Most of these reasons are out of mere curiosity, and they will cease once they tire of it.</p>
									<hr>
									<h4 class="text-center">Countermeasures</h4>
									<p>Once a disaster has occurred, there is no choice but to seek help from a specialist who has the power to resolve it.</p>
									<p>The only thing an average human can do is find a way to survive.</p>
									<p>Aside from these times, vampires are relatively polite.</p>
									<p>They are usually not a threat.</p>
									<p>But that doesn't mean you should anger them.</p>
									<p>You shouldn't do something that strikes one of their weaknesses, even by accident.</p>
									<p>A halfhearted attack will only result in enraging them.</p>
									<p>In order not to unintentionally offend them, it's necessary to have a thorough knowledge of their weaknesses.</p>

									<p>If one refers to vampires that are known to exist in Gensokyo, they must be the Scarlet family living in the Scarlet Devil Mansion.</p>
									<p>Its mistress is the <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="She was called the Scarlet Devil before coming to Gensokyo. This came from the fact that she often spills blood and stains her white clothes.">Scarlet Devil</a>, Remilia Scarlet.</p>
									<p>Her appearance and behavior might seem childish, but she has actually lived for more than 500 years and possesses amazing physical powers, as vampires do.</p>
									<p>She's short and looks as a little girl under the age of ten, but she has wings with a span wider than her height, and by looking at her silhouette, she may seem quite large.</p>
									<p>Her ego is large as well.</p>
									<p>Her actions are similarly childlike, and combined with her amazing strength and inexhaustible curiosity make her a fearsome devil that may explode at any time.</p>
									<p>She sleeps during the day in the Scarlet Devil Mansion. At night, she takes walks or hosts a party and has as much fun as she can before becoming tired and returning to her slumber.</p>
									<p>It is not sure whether or not she is using her ability to manipulate fate consciously, but it is said misfortune will befall those who are merely in her vicinity, and she can cause great change in the state of the daily lives of others with but a word.</p>
									<p><a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Actual results may vary, but there are no visual indication of when her ability is in effect.">For example, becoming more likely to encounter rare things.</a></p>

									<h4 class="text-center">Red Mist Incident</h4>
									<p>This incident led to many humans learning of the existence of the Scarlet Devil Mansion.</p>
									<p>There was an incident where Gensokyo was shrouded in a deep red mist so the sunlight could not reach the Earth, leading to a summer with low temperatures.</p>
									<p>Inhaling the mist worsen the condition of those who did so, and led to people being unable to leave not only the human village, but even their homes over the course of the next several days.</p>
									<p>It was Remilia behind the appearance of this mist, with the selfish intent of blocking the sunlight so that she could remain active during the day as well.</p>
									<p>It's said that in the end, the shrine maiden of the Hakurei Shrine punished her to bring an end this incident.</p>
									<hr>
									<h4 class="text-center">Eyewitness Reports</h4>
									<blockquote>
										<p>I saw her at a cherry blossom-viewing party. She was using a parasol. If she's weak to sunlight, why doesn't she wait until night?</p>
										<footer>Anonymous</footer>
									</blockquote>
									<p>She is a vampire who is often spotted in the daytime as well.</p>
									<p>It seems that parasols are ideal in blocking ultraviolet rays.</p>
									<blockquote>
										<p>I saw her at a cherry blossom-viewing party at night. I guess she does it then since she's weak to sunlight.</p>
										<footer>Anonymous</footer>
									</blockquote>
									<p>Rather, it is highly possible she was at viewing parties for the entire day.</p>
									<blockquote>
										<p>I was wounded and could barely move, but someone from the Scarlet Devil Mansion helped me and let me lodge in. They call it the Devil's Mansion, but she was unexpectedly kind. However, there wasn't anything much to eat, and since it was very noisy during the night, I couldn't sleep, so I ran away as soon as I could.</p>
										<footer>Anonymous</footer>
									</blockquote>
									<p>Vampires are surprisingly polite.</p>
									<p>Especially since they try not to eat the humans in Gensokyo.</p>
									<p>However, it might be that <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Actual results may vary, but there are no visual indication of when her ability is in effect.">your fate to 'die like an animal' had been altered.</a></p>
									<hr>
									<h4 class="text-center">Countermeasures</h4>
									<p>Although she is a youkai with many weak points, it is not a good idea to exploit them and agitate her.</p>
									<p>Since she cannot be exterminated under normal circumstances, you will most likely anger her and simply be blown away.</p>
									<p>Since she has abundant curiosity, she may choose to invite humans to her parties or play in the human villages on a whim.</p>
									<p>However, because she is childish, you must be careful not to render her in a bad mood. Otherwise, there may be terrifying consequences.</p>
									<p>You will have to put up with her selfishness.</p>
									<p>She thinks that nobody is superior to her, not only among humans but among youkai as well.</p>
									<p>Because of her haughty attitude, she is friendly to none.</p>

									<p><b>Ability:</b> Destruction of anything and everything<br>
										<b>Threat level:</b> Very High<br>
										<b>Human friendship level:</b> Very Low<br>
										<b>Main place of activity:</b> Scarlet Devil Mansion</p>
									<hr>
									<p>There are two vampires in the Scarlet Devil Mansion.</p>
									<p>The older sister and the mansion's mistress, Remilia Scarlet, and her younger sister, Flandre Scarlet.</p>
									<p><a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Perhaps she's locked away, but it's also rumored she's a shut-in.">Flandre seldom leaves the Scarlet Devil Mansion</a>, but her existence has been confirmed by humans that enter it on occasion.</p>
									<p>She has unusual seven-colored wings, and her hair is a light blond color, but her build and apparent age are similar to that of her older sister, Remilia.</p>
									<p>The two wings on her back are of an irregular shape unlike those of any living creature, youkai or ghost.</p>
									<p>She has few friends even among the youkai of the Scarlet Devil Mansion, and spends most of her time in isolation.</p>
									<p>Even her older sister Remilia is seldom seen together with her.</p>
									<p>As a result, much about her is shrouded in mystery.</p>
									<p>It is said she possesses the ability to destroy anything at all even without touching them.</p>
									<p>Everything that is made for her to play with ends up broken, so she probably doesn't have many playmates.</p>
									<p>Her method of destroying things so effortlessly involves pouring her power into the "eyes" of any material where its tension is the highest.</p>
									<p>She can use her ability to cause these "eyes" to move into the palm of her hand.</p>
									<p>In other words, <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="When she clenches her fist, the subject breaks.">by crushing the "eye" held within her hand</a>, she causes things to break.</p>
									<p>It's a truly frightening ability with no real weaknesses.</p>
									<hr>
									<h4 class="text-center">Eyewitness Reports</h4>
									<blockquote>
										<p>Sometimes when I sneak into the Scarlet Devil Mansion like I own it, I run into the little sister. I had to slip by without drawin' her attention, but after goin' through all that to get into the place, I was hopin' I wouldn't run into her.</p>
										<footer>Marisa Kirisame</footer>
									</blockquote>
									<p>What a terribly selfish report.</p>
									<blockquote>
										<p>I doubt she can fly with those wings.</p>
										<footer>Reimu Hakurei</footer>
									</blockquote>
									<p><a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Don't worry, everyone is able to fly even without wings.">It is plausible she cannot.</a></p>
									<blockquote>
										<p>I saw her shadow wandering around the mansion while I was at an outdoor party at the Scarlet Devil Mansion. It was truly frightening. I knew it was her just from the silhouette, but she doesn't get to join many parties.</p>
										<footer>Anonymous</footer>
									</blockquote>
									<p>Almost like something from a horror story.</p>
									<hr>
									<h4 class="text-center">Countermeasures</h4>
									<p>Since it's unlikely anyone will ever see or meet her, there isn't anything of which to be aware, but all you need to remember is that there are two vampires that live in the Scarlet Devil Mansion.</p>
									<p>Even if her older sister Remilia is away, you should remember that there's another vampire inside the mansion, and not sneak in unprepared.</p>
									<p>There are many mysteries to her abilities, and such simple things as the range of her ability and how to defeat her are unknown.</p>
									<p>The one thing that can be said is that it is an extremely dangerous ability.</p>
									<p>On top of that, she also possesses the usual superhuman strength attributed to vampires, so it would surely be impossible to put up a fight against her.</p>
