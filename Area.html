									<p>Even if you were to meet a youkai in the village, <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="There is a high probability that they are far older than you.">you should greet them respectfully as if they were your elder.</a></p>

									<p>Since many youkai are active at night, such stores are quite prosperous.</p>
									<p>It is said that youkai are good customers.</p>

									<p>On the eastern edge of Gensokyo lies its only shrine.</p>
									<p>This shrine exists on the border <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="To be accurate, the place where this shrine exists is not Gensokyo.">between the outside world and Gensokyo.</a></p>
									<p>All of Gensokyo can be seen from this shrine, and it is famous for having the most beautiful cherry blossom trees.</p>
									<p>The Hakurei shrine maiden, who specializes in incident resolution, lives here.</p>
									<p>She watches over Gensokyo from here, and when an incident arises, she will go out immediately and ascertain the cause.</p>
									<p>It's said that she resolved the recent Scarlet Mist incident.</p>
									<p>Although normally youkai should not approach the shrine, there is a rumor that it has become a den of youkai, and that humans no longer approach.</p>
									<p>Just as in the village, one is ensured safety from attacks by youkai while at the shrine; however, as the path between the shrine and the village is an animal trial with poor visibility, and since safety cannot be guaranteed, it has always prevented people from visiting the shrine to worship.</p>
									<p>It has other special traits, such as items from the outside world appearing within the proximity of the shrine or people from the outside world spotted nearby.</p>
									<p>A human being from outside will become food shortly after encountering a youkai, but if his luck is sufficient to find the shrine, <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="It is said that the human beings who don't want to return outside have increased in number lately.

									<p>Most of the items from the outside world are mysterious, and are popular among humans and youkai alike.</p>
									<p>For this reason, many collectors like to gather around the shrine.</p>
									<p>However, it is said that the purpose of most of the discovered objects is unknown.</p>

									<p>If you go towards the Forest of Magic from the human village, you'll see a strange building.</p>
									<p>This building is the antique store Kourindo. There are piles of items both inside and outside that no one entirely understands, and it's so quiet and gloomy that one can't know if it's really intending to do business.</p>
									<p>This is the sole shop in all Gensokyo that deals with outside world, youkai, netherworld and magic items.</p>
									<p>However, not even the store owner knows how to use the outside world articles, and although there are many people interested in them, <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="The reality is that the owner is a collector but him not being interested in selling most of the items is entirely a rumor.">most of those items are not for sale.</a></p>
									<p>None of the merchandise has price tags, so when there's something you want, you will have to bargain with the store owner.</p>
									<p>And besides, outside items are frequently out of stock, so once they are sold you can't know when another is going to arrive.</p>
									<p>But then again, since no one knows how to use them anyway, they end up not selling.</p>
									<p>The owner, Rinnosuke Morichika, strangely doesn't make any distinction between humans and youkai, dealing with both of them.</p>
									<p>In fact, he is a human-youkai half-breed himself. <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Maybe because of his disagreeable personality.">He doesn't attack humans, and he is not attacked by youkai either.</a></p>
									<p>Even though the path from the human village to Kourindou is somewhat long with many places where youkai are likely to appear, it's difficult to visit the shop casually, but there are many surprisingly interesting items there.</p>

									<p>The surroundings of this lake are shrouded in mist at noon, so visibility is poor.</p>
									<p>Near the lake fairies and youkai often gather, and, especially in summer, youkai gather there in search of a watering hole.</p>
									<p>It is not clearly understood why it tends to be foggy just at noontime.</p>
									<p>Since the visibility is so bad, the lake seems unbelievably huge, but it is actually believed not to be that big.</p>

									<p>Looking out from the human village, exactly opposite Youkai Mountain is where the expanse of the Bamboo Forest of the Lost lies.</p>
									<p>This bamboo forest has very little in the way of landmarks, and furthermore the bamboo grows so quickly that scenery is constantly changing, thus it is certain that one will become lost.</p>
									<p>There are no clearings there, the ground is mostly flat and indistinguishable, the bamboo grows diagonally and will drive your sense of balance insane and even when attempting to purposefully walk straight, before you know it, you'll have returned to where you just started.</p>
									<p>Furthermore, beasts who became youkai prefer to live here in this bamboo forest. <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="But bamboo shoots are delicious.">This is certainly not a place for normal humans to go.</a></p>
									<p>However, it is said that there are many hidden things within this bamboo forest.</p>
									<p>First of all, a peaceful mansion called Eientei has been confirmed to be here.</p>
									<p>Within this mansion live extremely enigmatic humans and rabbits.</p>
									<p><a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="There's very little credibility, and in any case, no way to confirm this.">Additionally, there is someone who discovered some suspiciously shimmering bamboo, a birdhouse for a small sparrow, a bamboo garden with flowers that only bloom once every 60 years and information regarding what underground youkai have seen beneath the roots of the bamboo plants.</a></p>
									<p>Even with these offerings, it would be best for anyone other than skilled bamboo harvesters to set foot in this bamboo forest.</p>

									<p>The distance from the human village is relatively short, but the forest's environment is extremely hazardous to humans, the spores of monster mushrooms dance about in midair and a normal human breathing the air in here would cause their physical condition to worsen.</p>
									<p>However, as the typical youkai will find the place uncomfortable, another feature of the forest that even youkai refrain from entering.</p>
									<p>For that reason, if one could stand the noxious gasses that the monstrous mushrooms emit, then on the contrary, it would be both a safe and secretive place to seclude oneself.</p>
									<p>The forest has areas of ground upon which the sun never shines, making them dark and damp.</p>
									<p>Therefore, mushrooms grow endlessly there.</p>
									<p>There are mushrooms here that can be used for food for humans who can withstand them, but they don't look very appealing. And also, there are a relatively high number of mushrooms with hallucinogenic properties.</p>
									<p>Once again, there are a relatively high number of mushrooms with hallucinogenic properties.</p>
									<p>The reason why it was called the Forest of Magic in the first place is because of the wide number of hallucinogenic mushrooms growing there.</p>
									<p>Simply being near them will make hallucinations appear as if entranced by magic.</p>
									<p>And also, for the sake of increasing their magical powers with these hallucinogenic mushrooms, there are many magicians who live in this forest.</p>

									<p>However, because of that strong internal cohesion, the resistance towards outsiders can be quite formidable.</p>
									<p>Trespassers in particular will be chased out no matter the circumstances, unleashing all available power if necessary.</p>

									<p>As to the question of how a road the dead travel can have merchant stands along it, the finances of Hell had reached the point where it could no longer sustain itself merely from the ferrying fees levied on the departed, so it opened stands along the Road of Liminality in an attempt to earn some more money.</p>

									<p>There are also many rooms without windows inside, which complicate it further.</p>

									<p>After death, humans pass through the Road of Liminality, cross over the Sanzu River, and receive the Yama's judgment. Depending on the severity of their crimes, they are sent to Hell, to the Netherworld, to Heaven or to other places.</p>
									<p>Among those, the Netherworld is a world where the guiltless dead spend their time as ghosts, until they achieve nirvana or reincarnate.</p>
									<p>Different from the desolate Hell, it is calm, though it has various seasons. It is filled with beautiful cherry blossoms in spring, and dyed with beautiful red leaves in autumn.</p>
									<p>However, the bugs, birds and animals are basically dead.</p>
									<p>Without any sort of cry, they fly in the sky silently and splendidly.</p>
									<p>Because it is so beautiful, <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Upon nirvana, one can go to Heaven, but Heaven is already full, and so I hear that nirvana is restricted now.">many ghosts stay there forgetting nirvana or reincarnation.</a></p>
									<p>Of course, most people are the dead in this world, but recently a hole opened in the barrier between the Netherworld and real world, and it became easier to come and go.</p>
									<p>The Netherworld is a notable place for people in the know for their cherry blossom viewing parties.</p>
									<p>Also, there is an unbelievably huge manor named Hakugyokurou in the Netherworld.</p>
									<p>It is a beautiful structure, surrounded by walls and stairs with using designs from the continent, and has a Japanese-style residence and Zen garden at its highest level.</p>

									<p>In the Netherworld, there exists a mansion with an unbelievably huge garden known as Hakugyokurou.</p>

									<p>Usually open to the public, the garden is often full of ghosts that come to savor its elegance.</p>
									<p>The Saigyouji family is a special family in the Netherworld, a distinguished family that is permitted eternal residence along with the cherry trees of the Netherworld.</p>
									<p>They manage the spirits of the Netherworld from Hakugyokurou.</p>
									<p>As the inside of the building is generally not open to the public, not much is known about it, but it's said that the inner sanctuary is surrounded by a large, U-shaped rock garden.</p>
									<p>The reception hall opens out onto a garden covered in gravel with magnificent pine trees and further back beyond a short fence it is possible to see a vast orchard of cherry trees.</p>
									<p>From the hall, with the floor, walls and ceiling cut out, the scene looks like a great folding screen.</p>

									<p>A mysterious manor built deep in the bamboo forest, as if to hide it.</p>
									<p>The building is built like an ancient Japanese manor, but it shows no signs of wear.</p>
									<p><a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Since it's called the House of Eternity, perhaps the latter makes more sense.">It is as if it is constantly being maintained, or as if time has stopped.</a></p>
									<p>As it's deep within the bamboo forest, you likely won't be able to find it even if you want to visit.</p>
									<p>Only recently have there been people willing to guide others to the manor.</p>
									<p>Before then, nobody knew that there was a mansion in the middle of the forest.</p>
									<p>As a result, the mansion is shrouded in mystery.</p>
									<p>There is very little publicly-known information about the place. Even basic things like when it was built and the inhabitants themselves are unknown.</p>
									<p>In particular, the humans and youkai rabbits who live there seem to have no relations with the human village.</p>
									<p><a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="However, few made it to Eientei.">However, by holding recent events such as the Lunar Capital Exhibition,</a> it seems this manor may be opening up little by little.</p>

									<p>This isn't located in Gensokyo, but I'm writing about it due to its close relation to Eientei.</p>
									<p>The capital of the moon is said to be a great, ancient metropolis on the far side of the moon.</p>
									<p><a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="See the article on Yukari Yakumo.">According to the stories about the Genso-Lunar War,</a> this is the city that the youkai of Gensokyo invaded.</p>
									<p>It's understood from what records are left from that time that their civilization is extremely advanced.</p>
									<p>It is essentially impossible to get to the lunar capital now, but we can gather something about the current state of the lunar capital from the exhibitions held at Eientei.</p>
									<p>The lunar citizens possess weapons with a firepower that far surpasses anything here on Earth.</p>
									<p><a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="These various articles are said to be from long ago. Modern lunar civilization has surely advanced even further.">Youkai would surely be unable to stand a chance against weapons such as a rifle that can shoot a spread of many bullets in an instant, or small arms whose rounds cause great explosions, or guns that shoot bullets that the user can control after firing.</a></p>
									<p>Indeed, in light of such things as medicines that can cure all illnesses and lengthen lifespans, or sauces that can make dumplings ten times as flavorful, it's clear that not just their weaponry, but the whole of their civilization is more advanced than that of Gensokyo.</p>
									<p>It's unknown how long the citizens of the moon have been living there, but it's said that they live forever.</p>
									<p>The people of the moon consider the Earth to be a residence for the corrupted, and it's said that they use the Earth as a prison for those who commit serious crimes.</p>

									<p>Going through and beyond the Forest of Magic, one will come to a small road.</p>
									<p>If one were to proceed along this road, they would finally reach Muenzuka.</p>
									<p>When autumn comes around, the road becomes completely covered with higan flowers, dyeing the road a deep red.</p>
									<p>Muenzuka is a graveyard for those without relatives and those who committed suicide in the outside world, a place where many end up after wandering aimlessly.</p>
									<p>This area is a place where even the humans living on the furthest outskirts of Gensokyo never approach, <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Connections to the netherworld are also easily created here, as this is a place where several barriers overlap and intersect.">for the strong connection between that and the outside world can create openings at any time.</a></p>
									<p>As those who've committed suicide walk along this path when it is covered with higan flowers, the toxins will swirl around their bodies, something wondrous yet unpleasant takes place, in that their will to survive will become rejuvenated.</p>
									<p>And then, deciding to try once more, they will turn and retrace their steps.</p>
									<p>This is why this road has been called the "Road of Reconsideration."</p>
									<p>Once again, this road is a place where encountering a human from the outside world is very likely.</p>
									<p>Because of this, there are also nasty youkai who lie in wait, hoping for a meal.</p>
									<p><a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Depressed people, spiteful people bearing grudges, criminals and the like are the favorite foods of youkai. There are plenty of those kinds of people here.">To have gone to the trouble of enduring the struggles of reconsideration, and just when one is thinking about maybe once again trying their best, being preyed upon by a youkai is no kind of repayment or reward.</a></p>

									<p>Heading further along the Road of Reconsideration, one would reach Muenzuka, where the road ends.</p>
									<p>Although it's a small area enclosed by trees, this is the most dangerous place for both the humans and youkai of Gensokyo.</p>
									<p>Although this place is a graveyard for those without relatives, many of those were from the outside world, but became lost and ended up here, and the growing inclination towards the outside world has begun to gradually loosen the magic barrier.</p>
									<p><a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Originally, being able to cross the magic barrier was impossible, but the current situation is exactly what has come to pass. For this reason, maintaining one's presence here has become difficult.">Also, as it is something similar to a graveyard, and also easily connected to the Netherworld, it's a place where no one knows what might happen.</a></p>
									<p>However, there are lovely things called purple cherry blossoms trees. Although their numbers are small, nothing else in Gensokyo can match their simple beauty.</p>
									<p>When the flowers of these cherry blossoms fall, the deceased of Muenzuka will be released from their hestitation, and will finally progress to the Road of Liminality.</p>
									<p>The purple cherry blossoms purify the soil of Muenzuka, and once per year this severing of doubts and fears causes the flowers to blossom, and even for Gensokyo, this is a quite a peculiar youkai cherry tree.</p>
									<p>Those flower petals that drop by ones and twos create a sight reminiscent of something like Muenzuka itself weeping, an illusion that will beguile any viewer.</p>
									<p>This might be the most perfect place for flower viewing, or so one might think, but the sorrowful sights create such sadness that there is no one who is able to make merry while watching them.</p>

									<p>Obviously Higan is not part of Gensokyo, but I'll introduce it here anyway.</p>
									<p>Compared to the Netherworld where the living can come and go relatively easily, <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Rather, if you go, you die. Although there is a chance that the dead can breath again before they cross the river, once they make it across they cannot come back to life.">the living cannot go to Higan because of the Sanzu River.</a></p>
									<p>Higan is a endless flower garden where there is no night nor day nor seasons, just a gentle warm light that envelops the whole of the land.</p>
									<p>All people do here is to await the Enma's judgement.</p>
									<p><a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Lately, there had been so many dead people that the Bar of the Ten Kings cannot keep up with them.">They don't sleep, eat or talk. All they do is wait, and by doing so they realize that they are dead.</a></p>
									<p>It's okay if you are sent to the Netherworld, but if you descend into Hell you'll fall outside the circle of transmigration and shall never enjoy the sights of cherry blossoms and the taste of sake again.</p>
