									<h4 class="text-center">Characteristics</h4>
									<p>The true identity of natural phenomena themselves.</p>
									<p>Fairies live in such phenomena where it gets cold and hot, rain falls and wind blows, grass grows and flowers bloom.</p>
									<p>They come in various shapes, but many of them are humanoid with wings like those of insects like butterflies and dragonflies.</p>
									<p>Their height is uniformly small, from the degree where they can fit in the palm of one's hand, up to the size of a child below 
									ten years of age. There is hardly any fairy outside of this scope.</p>
									<p>They live wherever there is nature.</p>
									<p>You can confirm their existence anywhere in Gensokyo.</p>
									<p>They especially prefer active places, so when humans and youkai gather you can probably spot lots of them.</p>
									<p>On the other hand, in gloomy places their numbers decrease.</p>
									<p>They are a kind of youkai you frequently can see even in human villages.</p>
									<p>Fairies are active at all hours, so you can probably encounter them both at daytime and in the night.</p>
									<p>They don't seem to follow any manner of law or code.</p>
									<p><a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Fairies lives differs from that of humans, so it is a mistake to say that they are short-lived.">Also, an individual fairy is short-lived</a>, but they immediately resurrect in the same shape.</p>
									<p>Even if they suffer large injuries so that their bodies are in pieces, they heal immediately.</p>
									<p>In a stricter sense, fairies can't die.</p>
									<p>Therefore they take reckless action, without fearing death.</p>
									<p>Since their concept of death appears to differ from that of humans, it is also said that they are simply foolish.</p>
									<p>Fairies don't actually need to eat, but they see the way humans enjoy their meals and copy them, eating the same things.</p>
									<p>They eat anything which humans do.</p>
									<p>They especially like to sneak away that which humans are planning to eat.</p>
									<hr>
									<h4 class="text-center">Potential Harm</h4>
									<p>Pranks on a Whim.</p>
									<p>They all like pranks.</p>
									<p>If they catch sight of a human walking somewhere, they make them lose their way.</p>
									<p>When you're cleaning, they'll raise the wind to send all your gathered dust flying.</p>
									<p>When you are not looking, they put salt in your tea.</p>
									<p>Without thinking of the consequences, they disturb the actions of whomever they see.</p>
									<p>There are also occasionally pranks that go too far, such as when you get pushed off a cliff, 
									or when your back is set on fire, so it is necessary to be cautious.</p>
									<hr>
									<h4 class="text-center">Countermeasures</h4>
									<p>When you walk down the road while thinking about something else, you lose your way.</p>
									<p>When you're absorbed in conversation with a friend, your bags are carried away when you're not looking.</p>
									<p>Things like these are sometimes thought to be caused by fairies.</p>
									<p>The people that most easily get pulled into pranks are those that are uncautious and prone to being preoccupied with other things.</p>
									<p>Fairies won't go near cautious people.</p>
									<p>Therefore, if you usually pay attention to your surroundings, you should be fine.</p>
									<p>But if you were to be subjected to a prank, what should you do?</p>
									<p>The truth is that while fairies are reckless, they don't like fighting much at all.</p>
									<p>When a human notices the prank, the fairies will probably run away as fast as they can.</p>
									<p>If you were to be successful in catching one, you can freely vent your anger on it since they're not very strong.</p>
									<p>A grown human should win easily.</p>
									<p>However, there are also the occasional exceptions where without doing any pranks, they just suddenly attack.</p>
									<p>At such times you must be careful.</p>
									<p>That is because there is a possibility that it is a warning for something.</p>
									<p>Especially when fairies aggregate in large numbers or start clamoring, 
										<a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="The number and ferocity of fairies expresses the threat level of the surrounding area.">
										there is a possibility that there is an unbelievably powerful youkai lurking about nearby.
										</a>
										Therefore, you must be careful.</p>
									<p>At such times, I think it's best if you just quietly head back home.</p>

									<hr>
									<p>Close to the lake, there are times when the temperature lowers drastically even in summer.</p>
									<p>A fairy you are likely to encounter at such times is this ice fairy.</p>
									<p>Among the fairies around the lake she has a leader-like presence, and is stronger than the other fairies.</p>
									<p>She belongs to the more belligerent variety of fairies, and so it is necessary to be careful.</p>
									<p>She is quite short and dressed in blue with wings of ice.</p>
									<p>She has the ability to manipulate the cold.</p>
									<p>Being able freeze small objects instantly, she is a bit more dangerous than regular fairies.</p>
									<p>She emits cold air constantly, so her vicinity is always chilly.</p>
									<p>Since where she lives is totally unknown, there is no way of telling how she spends her everyday life.</p>
									<p>Not just Cirno's, but all fairies' homes blend into nature, preventing them from being seen by humans.</p>

									<p>Since there are many other sightings near the Misty Lake as well, it is presumed that is where her home is located.</p>
									<p>It is possible that she has a house in underwater.</p>

									<p>And here I thought that no humans fished at the Misty Lake...</p>
									<p>There is the danger of other youkai appearing in that area, so inexperienced people would do best in not copying this example.</p>
									<hr>
									<h4 class="text-center">Countermeasures</h4>
									<p>If it suddenly gets cold, there is a possibility that the ice fairy is nearby.</p>
									<p>At such times you should be obedient and flee, or look for the shape of the fairy.</p>
									<p>Fairies usually do nothing and keep their distance when they understand that they are noticed.</p>
									<p>Since Cirno is easily noticed, I assume that as long as one is not very careless there is little risk of being injured.</p>
									<p>Still, if you are to pass through place where she seems to be around, what's the best way of doing it?</p>
									<p>She's weak against fire from torches and other objects too hot to touch.</p>
									<p>If you're holding a torch to start with she probably won't go near.</p>
									<p>Since she can freeze things she touches instantly, refrain from touching her even if she is asleep.</p>
									<p>There is a risk of frostbite.</p>
									<p>If by any chance Cirno should attack, just start to talk calmly about anything, and when she shows interest it is a good time to ask her a riddle.</p>
									<p>When you do that, she will start to think of the answer, and that is a good opportunity to escape.</p>
									<p>No matter how simple the question, she can certainly not answer it.</p>

									<hr>
									<p><b>Usual threat level:</b> Low<br>
									<b>Ability: </b>Announcing the arrival of spring<br>
									<b>Threat level:</b> Extremely Low<br>
									<b>Human friendship level:</b> High<br>
									<b>Main place of activity:</b> Varies</p>
									<hr>
									<p>When it is spring, humans, youkai and ghosts suddenly become more active. In fact, there are few who do not.</p>
									<p>The fairy who symbolizes this activity is the fairy who bears spring, Lily White.</p>
									<p>Lily White notices the trivial changes that normal humans don't notice, 
										<a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Including phantoms and ghosts.">
											and tells all living things 
										</a>
										that have been in deep hibernation during the winter that the season of awakening has come.
									</p>
									<p>After the passing of this fairy, everything becomes wrapped in the joy of spring.</p>
									<p>Her height is quite low, and 
										<a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="It may appear that she has a great number of thin, bird-like wings, but in fact, she has two large wings.">
											she has many thin wings.
										</a>
									</p>
									<p>She is not agressive, and even if you come across her, her threat level is low.</p>
									<p>However, disturbing her while she is conveying her message would not be wise.</p>
									<p>This is when this fairy is at her strongest.</p>
									<p>Like other fairies, where she lives is unknown.</p>
									<p>And she has rarely been seen during any season other than spring.</p>
									<p>Because of that, Lily has become synonymous with the season of spring.</p>
									<hr>
									<h4 class="text-center">Eyewitness Reports</h4>
									<blockquote>

									<p>The Fairy Herald of Spring referred to in this poem is Lily White.</p>
									<blockquote>
										<p>She always appears from the west and disappears <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Youkai Mountain. Mentioned later.">toward the mountain</a>, but there is no instance in which she has been seen going back the other way. Where in the world does she live? 
										</p>
										<footer>Reported by many sources</footer>
									</blockquote>
									<p>Perhaps the reason that she's never seen returning from the mountain is that, each year, she's eaten by the mountain youkai and stops announcing spring.</p>
									<blockquote>
										<p>My child caught her. Perhaps because she immediately said "Let me go!" and my child promptly let her go, there fortunately wasn't any damage.										</p>
										<footer>Anonymous Parent</footer>
									</blockquote>
									<p>This fairy isn't the sort that would usually injure humans, but it's generally safer not to get involved with non-humans.</p>
									<hr>
									<h4 class="text-center">Countermeasures</h4>
									<p>If you don't do anything to her, there's no real danger.</p>
									<p>In fact, catching sight of her is a good omen.</p>
									<p>She simply wants to celebrate the fact that spring has come.</p>
									<p>If she happens to attack, it's possible that she's just excited, so the best course of action is to leave the area.</p>
									<p>This fairy won't be able to leave any place that is turning to spring.</p>
									<p>If you get away from her, there's no need to worry that she might chase after you.</p>
									<p>In fact, it could be interesting to set out bait in order to tame her.</p>
									<p>If you prepare some flower seeds for her, she'll gladly make any nearby flowers bloom.</p>
									<p>Because of this, she's a fairy who's very popular with florists.</p>

									<p>Sunny Milk, in particular, is a fairy whose specialty is making people lose their way.</p>
									<p>Since it is possible to change how the environment looks from reality through refracting light, it can fool humans.</p>
									<p>Also, as she can hide herself behind this diffraction, it can be difficult to capture her.</p>
									<p>Her stature is quite short, and she possesses thin, insect-like wings.</p>
									<p>She's the type of fairy who plays terrible pranks on humans but gets away at full speed when they notice her.</p>
									<p>Fairies like this won't approach humans that are highly cautious.</p>
									<p>If you don't want to get involved with them, you must behave as if always thinking of the possibility that a fairy is lurking nearby.</p>
									<p>Also, she rarely acts alone. <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="The other two are Luna Child and Star Sapphire.">She usually moves with a group of three.</a></p>
									<p>It's said that she lives inside a huge tree in the Forest of Magic, but the precise location is unknown.</p>

									<h4 class="text-center">Countermeasures</h4>
									<p>In any case, you have to be careful when you walk.</p>
									<p>There is the danger of the road in front of you suddenly turning into a river.</p>
									<p>Fairies will avoid attentive humans, and dogs with acute senses.</p>
									<p>If you are in a hurry, you should bring a dog with you.</p>
									<p>There is no danger in confronting her, as she will immediately run away. However, even if you want to punish her, it's almost impossible to catch her.</p>
									<p>If you fall victim of a prank, you can only curse <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="It would be best to ignore them, because it would feel awful to think that fairies are laughing somewhere.">your carelessness.</a></p>

									<p>I believe you might have had an experience in which, during a windy day, the wind's sound suddenly vanished, even though the wind hadn't stopped, and then soon after the sound came back again.</p>

									<p>Fairies are beings that can't harm nor benefit humans.</p>
									<p>Their pranks don't necessarily cause direct harm to people.</p>
									<p>Luna Child has the ability to silence the sounds around herself.</p>
									<p>This in itself can't cause much harm, but she often joins up with other fairies, particularly Sunny Milk and Star Sapphire, carrying out their pranks as a trio.</p>
									<p>Her stature is quite short, and she possesses thin, insect-like wings.</p>
									<p>Out of the red, white and blue trio of fairies, <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Sunny Milk is red, and Star Sapphire is blue. These are the colors of their clothes.">the white one</a> is Luna Child.</p>
									<p>Out of the three fairies, she might be the dumbest one, or maybe she just relies too much in her ability to make sound vanish that she's often the only one who fails to escape.</p>
									<p>It seems that when her ability is used along with Sunny Milk's light diffraction, it can hide both form and sound, producing a truly fearsome stealthiness. But even so, they are still fairies, after all.</p>

									<p>To counteract this, the most reliable method is to be always making sound.</p>
									<p>When this fairy gets close to anywhere there is noise, you will know she is there because it will become silent.</p>
									<p>That means she won't get caught if she doesn't use her ability, but being a fairy, she will be unable to realize this.</p>

									<p>When looking at the stars covering the night sky, it may sometimes seem that one is surrounded by the eyes of countless beasts or youkai.</p>
									<p>And there is a fairy with eyes that can survey as far as the light that falls down from the stars.</p>
									<p>That is the starlight fairy, Star Sapphire.</p>
									<p>She rarely attacks or disturbs humans, but she mostly causes trouble by helping with <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="The sunlight and the moonlight ones. The three troublesome Fairies of Light.">other fairies'</a> pranks</p>
									<p>Her stature is quite short, and she possesses large, butterfly-like wings.</p>

									<p>Fairies are very self-centered, so they easily come into conflict with each other.</p>
									<p>In this case, as the ice fairy is used to fighting, she would likely win by herself even against 3.</p>

									<p>Even though she cannot do a great amount of direct damage, she basically acts with with other two fairies, so the same counter-measure mentioned for Sunny Milk can be employed.</p>
									<p>However, when she is on observation duty for the other fairies, she can be a threat.</p>
									<p>Because even if you try, you can't elude her ability.</p>
									<p>The best and most reliable counter-measure against it is to use a separate creature.</p>
									<p>Star Sapphire's ability can't distinguish between a human and a similarly-sized animal.</p>
									<p>So, if you slip into a herd of animals and move along with them, she might not even notice you.</p>
									<p>In fact, this could be an interesting game as well.</p>
