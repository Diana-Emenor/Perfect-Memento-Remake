									<hr>
									<p><b>Usual threat level:</b> Low<br>
									<b>Frequency of encounter:</b> High<br>
									<b>Variety:</b> High<br>
									<b>Places likely to be encountered:</b> Anywhere<br>
									<b>Times likely to be encountered:</b> Anytime </p>
									<hr>
									<h4 class="text-center">Characteristics</h4>
									<p>They are the very spirits of animals or plants.</p>
									<p>Able to convert what they see, hear, touch or taste into thoughts, it can be said that they're like sense converters.</p>
									<p>Having no physical body nor specific form, they're similar to air.</p>
									<p>They can pass through any obstacle, and they can change their shape at will.</p>
									<p>They're often confused with bourei, which are always the embodiments of deceased, but yuurei are not necessarily always the spirits of the deceased.</p>
									<p>Some are even born as yuurei, and remain so until they dissipate into nothing.</p>
									<p>Also unlike bourei, a single corpse may spawn several yuurei.</p>
									<p>Their characteristics are closer to those of fairies; like how fairies are the embodiment of nature, yuurei are the embodiment of spirits.</p>
									<p><a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="If it can be said they are 'living'.">They can live</a> anywhere in Gensokyo.</p>
									<p>Yuurei that prefer noisy places gather in noisy places, ones that prefer gloomy places gather in gloomy places, and there are even those that prefer hot springs.</p>
									<p>They are usually active at night.</p>
									<p>It's assumed that because many of them have their existences on the verge of dissipating, it makes it difficult for them to act under sunlight.</p>
									<p>Also, their body temperature is <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Their hearts tend to be cold.">very low.</a></p>
									<p>Improper handling may even result in frostbite.</p>
									<p>However, this chill can be utilized for one's benefit; for example, during tests of courage.</p>
									<p>Passing through a place, as a test of courage, where many yuurei seem likely to gather is a good way to feel a chill on <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Thus yuurei are despised in winter.">a hot summer night.</a></p>
									<hr>
									<h4 class="text-center">Potential Harm</h4>
									<p>The most threatening feature a yuurei possesses is the ability to affect the minds of people around it.</p>
									<p>If one is surrounded by cheerful yuurei, they'll eventually feel pleasant.</p>
									<p>For gloomy yuurei, vice versa.</p>
									<p>For example, the places famous for suicides are often the places inhabited by gloomy yuurei.</p>
									<p>Those without enough mental fortuity might even lose their mind, if they happen to face a powerful yuurei.</p>
									<p>Also, due to their low temperature, sustained contact may cause frostbite.</p>
									<hr>
									<h4 class="text-center">Countermeasures</h4>
									<p>Avoiding encounters with yuurei is next to impossible, so all you can do attempt to remain unaffected upon contact.</p>
									<p>Generally, yuurei have transient and fragile existences.</p>
									<p>Even average humans should be fine if there are only a few of them.</p>
									<p>However, it's a different story if that person is <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Like when one has just been tricked by fairies.">mentally weakened.</a></p>
									<p>Keeping confidence in yourself and having no fear is the only way to deal with them.</p>
									<p>However, it would be a wise idea not to, out of curiosity, go to places <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Places such as graveyards. Yuurei often hold live concerts there.">where yuurei gather.</a></p>
									<p>It may result in your mind being shattered</p>
									<p>If that happens, there's no other way but to seek an exorcism <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="But the shrine maiden is not really dependable...">from a professional.</a></p>
									<p>On the other hand, there's currently research about the possibility of correcting one's personality by means of deliberate yuurei possession.</p>
									<p>This technique is expected to dissuade someone from committing suicide or helping someone overcome their dislike of vegetables.</p>
									<p>It's almost ready to be put into practical use, once a method of capturing yuurei is established.</p>
									<p>It's not far-fetched to say that the future of human mentality rests on yuurei shoulders.</p>

									<h3 class="text-center">Youmu Konpaku<br><small>Half-Human Half-Yuurei Gardener</small></h3>
									<hr>
									<img src="./Images/Characters/Youmu Konpaku.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered">
									<hr>
									<p><b>Ability:</b> The ability to use sword techniques<br>
									<b>Threat level:</b> Medium<br>
									<b>Human friendship level:</b> High<br>
									<b>Main place of activity:</b> Netherworld</p>
									<hr>
									<p>Since yuurei are formless, most people are unable to distinguish between normal ones.</p>
									<p>The Konpaku family are not simple yuurei, but are a lineage of half-human, half-yuurei.</p>
									<p>Her appearance does not differ from that of normal humans.</p>
									<p>Youmu's thought patterns are similar to a normal human's for the most part, but it's said her body temperature is a bit lower.</p>
									<p>Her lifespan is far longer than that of normal humans.</p>
									<p>This is probably because she is half yuurei, which do not have distinct lifespans.</p>
									<p>A large yuurei accompanies her human form.</p>
									<p>As this yuurei has human and yuurei attributes, this is one way to easily distinguish her from normal humans.</p>
									<p>The large yuurei can act on its own.</p>
									<p>Also, unlike normal yuurei, its body is not particularly cold to the touch.</p>
									<p>Youmu serves as the gardener for <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="This word is read Hakugyokurou, not Shiratamarou.">Hakugyokurou</a> in the Netherworld, and is also a live-in sword instructor, but lately she can frequently be seen in <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="This world, as opposed to the next world.">this world.</a></p>
									<p>Though, it is likely because <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="In the era of the 9th child of Miare, Akyuu.">lately</a> the barrier between this world and the next has weakened.</p>
									<p></p>
									<hr>
									<h4 class="text-center">Weapons and Abilities</h4>
									<p>She possesses superior swordsmanship, and is a master of the two-handed technique.</p>
									<p>The two swords she uses are called Hakurouken and Roukanken.</p>
									<p>The longer sword is Roukanken. It's believed that Roukanken was forged by youkai, and it's too long to be used by normal humans.</p>
									<p>It's said that it has the power to kill ten spirits in one stroke, but as one cannot actually <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Normally they are sent to nirvana or disappear.">kill spirits</a>, it's unknown if <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Supposedly the things it cannot cut are next to none.">this is true.</a></p>
									<p>The other sword, Hakurouken, is the ancestral sword of the Konpaku family, and it's said to have the power to dispel the confusion of those it cuts.</p>
									<p>That is, using it on yuurei will send them to nirvana, and using it on humans will cause them discomfort and a bit of pain.</p>
									<p>The exact details of its function are unclear, but it can only be handled by the Konpaku family.</p>
									<hr>
									<h4 class="text-center">Daily Life</h4>
									<p>She lives in the Netherworld in Hakugyokurou.</p>
									<p>She wakes up early in the morning before the mistress of the estate to patrol the gardens.</p>
									<p>During the day she tends to the gardens and trains her sword technique, and will go out on errands if called.</p>
									<p>At night, she patrols once again, and supposedly goes to bed only after confirming that the mistress has done so.</p>
									<p>If she were to discover an intruder at this time, she would surely cut them down at once whether they were human or youkai.</p>
									<hr>
									<h4 class="text-center">Eyewitness Reports</h4>
									<blockquote>
										<p>When I go to visit the Netherworld, she always swings those swords at me. It'd be nice if she'd actually saw who was coming.</p>
										<footer>Reimu Hakurei</footer>
									</blockquote>
									<p>It's questionable why living humans would go to the Netherworld to visit.</p>
									<blockquote>
										<p>She comes shopping here a lot. It's like someone is coming to take you to the next world, and it feels pretty weird.</p>
										<footer>Anonymous</footer>
									</blockquote>
									<p>It would be nice if you'd be more tolerant if she's just coming to shop...</p>
									<blockquote>
										<p>I thought a dangerous, sword-wielding youkai had come, but she looks sort of powerless, and I can't help feeling sorry for her, somehow.</p>
										<footer>Anonymous</footer>
									</blockquote>
									<p>Her appearance is that of a young girl.</p>
									<hr>
									<h4 class="text-center">Countermeasures</h4>
									<p>She is a yuurei, but she's also half human.</p>
									<p>It's possible to come to mutual understanding with her, so conflict can be avoided through discussion.</p>
									<p>Like other youkai, she doesn't assault humans without a purpose, such as food or boredom.</p>
									<p>If you don't challenge, provoke or put her in a blatantly disadvantageous situation, she will likely not attack you.</p>
									<p>Even if the situation looks threatening, she will not fight anyone lacking in training, so that will at least make her go easy on you.</p>
									<p>If you've done nothing wrong, you can probably talk your way out of a battle.</p>
									<p>Even if you've clearly done something wrong, things might work out somehow if you offer a proper apology.</p>
									<p>Now, what should one do in the unlikely event of being attacked by her?</p>
									<p>All normal human can hope to do in such a circumstance is offer a <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Namo amithaba Buddhaya.">prayer to Buddha.</a></p>

									<hr>
									<p>Technically speaking, poltergeists are not yuurei, but there are no other appropriate classifications for them so they are described here.</p>
									<p>The Prismriver Ensemble is a so-called <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="This is not meant to mean that its members are always absent.">phantom ensemble</a> that are often called to perform at events such as youkai parties.</p>
									<p>They're famous for playing vigorous songs with a strong rhythm, so they are the most well-known band in Gensokyo.</p>
									<p>The ensemble is composed of three poltergeist sisters; Lunasa is the oldest of the three and excels at the violin.</p>
									<p>She appears to be the leader of the Prismriver Ensemble.</p>
									<p>Her height is around that of a teenaged human girl.</p>
									<p>Her appearance does not differ significantly from a human's.</p>
									<p>Her violin is said to be the yuurei of an instrument that would outclass even a <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="They say this at the beginning of their live performances.">Stradivarius</a>, but it's unknown whether this is true or not.</p>
									<p>In any case, it's a yuurei.</p>
									<p>Another word for poltergeists are <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="This may not be true. Poltergeists are said to be one form of magic used by young maidens.">noisy spirits</a>, as they are spirits which are able to make sounds.</p>
									<p>The noises that poltergeists make are actually the yuurei of notes.</p>
									<p>Since they're perceived by the spirit and not the ears, even beings without bodies can enjoy them.</p>
									<p>At the same time, humans should be careful that its effect doesn't overwhelm them.</p>
									<p>She is a very collected person, but she is recitent and glum.</p>
									<p>The sounds she creates calm the spirit.</p>
									<p>People who are overly influenced by her sounds will lose all motivation and become depressed.</p>
									<p>She's said to live in a ruined Western mansion a bit farther from the lake than the Scarlet Devil Manor.</p>
									<p>You won't see the sisters there even if you set foot inside.</p>
									<p>However, it's said that you will hear the sounds of their practicing.</p>
									<hr>
									<h4 class="text-center">Eyewitness Reports</h4>
									<blockquote>
										<p>Sometimes I happen to come across a youkai party, but I'll end up joining in against my better judgment once I hear the Prismrivers' music playing.</p>
										<footer>Anonymous</footer>
									</blockquote>
									<p>Humans should be able to join as well, as long as the youkai are still in the middle of their party.</p>

									</blockquote>
									<p>She isn't human, so something horrible might happen to you if you say things like that too often.</p>
									<hr>
									<h4 class="text-center">Countermeasures</h4>
									<p>She's very friendly to both humans and youkai, so you have nothing to fear from her.</p>
									<p>It should be noted that the Prismrivers do not manage ticket sales for their live performances. Their clients do, so it is inadvisable complaining to the Prismrivers if you can't acquire on a ticket.</p>
									<p>Their performances contain many notes that have a great effect on the spirit, so one should not attend unless one is in perfect mental condition.</p>
									<p>Children should not be allowed to listen.</p>
									<p>The notes of yuurei is a privilege for adults.</p>

									<hr>
									<p>Technically speaking, poltergeists are not yuurei, but there are no other appropriate classifications for them so they are described here.</p>
									<p>Merlin Prismriver is the middle sister of the <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="See the article on Lunasa Prismriver.">Prismriver Ensemble</a>, and her forte is the trumpet.</p>
									<p>She is the star of their performances, standing out the most.</p>
									<p>She has many fans.</p>
									<p>She looks just like a human.</p>
									<p>Of the three sisters, she is the tallest and her hair is the brightest, and she often takes center stage at live events.</p>
									<p>The trumpet she holds is said to be the yuurei of a <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="They say this at the beginning of their live performances.">fearful trumpet that's taken the blood of many jazz trumpeters</a>, but it's unknown if this is true or not.</p>
									<p>It is unclear how a trumpet would suck the blood of the living.</p>
									<p>She has an incredibly cheerful personality and is never seen depressed.</p>
									<p>She's known to sometimes blurt out incomprehensible words.</p>
									<p>The sounds she creates are sounds that uplift the spirit.</p>
									<p>People who are overly influenced by her sounds will do things such as break out into dancing, or become unable to hold a coherent conversation.</p>
									<p>It might be perfect for those suffering from depression.</p>
									<p>Usually the Prismriver Sisters perform as a group, but Merlin can also be seen acting independently.</p>
									<p>It seems she holds solo concerts, but going to see such a performance may be dangerous for the reasons outlined above.</p>
									<hr>
									<h4 class="text-center">Eyewitness Reports</h4>
									<blockquote>
										<p>On my way to the lake, I could hear the sound of brass instruments from far off.</p>
										<footer>Anonymous</footer>
									</blockquote>
									<p>It was thought to be the sounds of Merlin practicing.</p>
									<p>It may also have been a call for a tengu assembly.</p>
									<blockquote>
										<p>I went to see one of her solo performances, but it was a brass ensemble. Most of the time, it wouldn't be possible for one person...</p>
										<footer>Cheerful ghost</footer>
									</blockquote>
									<p>The instrument she uses is symbolic, so you shouldn't think that sound actually comes out of it.</p>
									<p>It's not well understood where the notes actually come from, but since they seem to actually be the yuurei of notes, they probably come from close by.</p>
									<blockquote>
										<p>What? Merlin isn't the leader?</p>
										<footer>Anonymous</footer>
									</blockquote>
									<p>She isn't human, so something horrible might happen to you if you say things like that too often.</p>
									<hr>
									<h4 class="text-center">Countermeasures</h4>
									<p>She is very friendly to both humans and youkai, so you have nothing to fear from her.</p>
									<p>However, it's hard to hold a conversation with her alone, so refrain from talking to her if you see her alone.</p>
									<p>As a phantom, her behavioral principles are different from those of humans, so while it's not impossible, mutual understanding is very difficult.</p>
									<p>It would be unfortunate to say the wrong thing and have her misunderstand you as <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Such misunderstandings are common due to difficulty in communication. Even praise can be dangerous.">spoiling for a fight.</a></p>
									<p>The Prismriver sisters themselves are fairly powerful, and the Prismriver Ensemble has many fans, so there is little hope of winning if you cross them.</p>
									<p>In addition, the sound of a trumpet can carry quite far, so if you happen to hear it from far off, take care not to listen too closely.</p>
									<p>It can affect your spirit.</p>

									<p><a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Phantom or not, a body is a body.">Her body</a> is the smallest of the three, but her music is dynamic.</p>

									<p>Her personality is the most human-like among the sisters, so she's easy to converse with.</p>
									<p>However, she does have a sly, worldly side to her.</p>
									<p>The sounds she creates are sounds that don't exist in the present world.</p>
									<p>Her sounds are the sort of sounds one can't imagine where they came from or how they were created.</p>
									<p>Rather than the yuurei of notes, one might say they're illlusionary notes.</p>
									<p>Compared to her sisters' sounds, they are unlike anything heard before, but they don't resonate with the mind and spirit, and are heard normally with the ears.</p>
									<p>Since they have no effect on the mind and spirit, you can listen to them without worry.</p>
									<p>She normally performs together with her other two sisters.</p>
									<p>If she ever acts on her own, she is probably quarreling with her sisters or has some ulterior purpose in mind.</p>
