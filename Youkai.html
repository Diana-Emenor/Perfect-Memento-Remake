									<h4 class="text-center">Characteristics</h4>
									<p>There are many types of youkai with extremely varied powers. Some races have a great number that are all categorized under a certain name, while others can be as few as a single member.</p>
									<p>These unique youkai are not called by whatever individual species they may be, but simply "youkai."</p>
									<p>Many of the youkai in Gensokyo fall into this <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="It might be confusing, but youkai as a race is similar to the 'Others' section of a graph. I suppose there are quite a few graphs where 'Others' is the largest category.">"youkai"</a> section.</p>
									<p>Rarely if ever is there any commonality in their appearance, ability, character, danger level, or times and places of activity.</p>
									<p>Just about the only thing in common between youkai is that they attack and prey upon humans.</p>
									<p>There are definitely exceptions, but many fall towards this trend.</p>
									<ul class="list-group">
										<li class="list-group-item"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-asterisk"></span>Youkai have longer lifespans than humans.</li>
										<li class="list-group-item"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-asterisk"></span>Youkai have stronger bodies than humans, so even if they're split into five parts, they heal right away.</li>
										<li class="list-group-item"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-asterisk"></span>Youkai are more easily affected by belief than humans, and as a result spiritual damage can cause fatal wounds.</li>
										<li class="list-group-item"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-asterisk"></span>Youkai generally do not move in groups.</li>
										<li class="list-group-item"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-asterisk"></span>Youkai only think of themselves.</li>
									</ul>
									<p>Youkai are the most dangerous enemies to humans.</p>
									<p>However, since they are rather varied, one must be informed of each of their traits before heading out to exterminate them.</p>
									<hr>
									<h3 class="text-center">Potential Harm<br><small>Kidnapping, Prededation, Livestock Theft, Crop Theft</small></h3>
									<p>Humans have no greater enemy than youkai.</p>
									<p>Youkai attack humans for food.</p>
									<p>However, most do not attack when they are full and satisfied.</p>
									<p>If the human population drops, youkai will face trouble as well.</p>
									<p>They do not eat only humans, but animals, birds, fish, vegetables, fruits, alcohol and other things humans normally eat.</p>
									<p>Still, they consider humans a delicacy above all else.</p>
									<p>They steal crops and livestock as well.</p>
									<p>This is also serious problem.</p>
									<hr>
									<h4 class="text-center">Countermeasures</h4>
									<p>Unless one thoroughly trains in fighting against them, youkai extermination is difficult.</p>
									<p>Youkai have a history of being physically stronger than humans, and trying to fight them may quickly end up as feeding them.</p>
									<p>However, the reason most youkai attack humans is because they need prey.</p>
									<p>That's why one should offer something else to eat in place of themselves.</p>
									<p>Offering a cow will save you from being attacked for a while.</p>
									<p>There are many that have a strong sense of duty, and will befriend those who do not turn against them.</p>
									<p>But exterminating youkai is a different story.</p>
									<p>Humans regularly perform exterminations, but this is a custom passed down from ancestors.</p>
									<p>In Gensokyo, <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="It is said that the balance of Gensokyo will crumble if they do not.">humans must exterminate youkai.</a></p>
									<p>There are those that specialize in youkai extermination.</p>
									<p>For example, the Hakurei shrine maiden is the most well-known specialist.</p>
									<p>In extermination, one does not use weapons that cause physical damage. Weapons with an "origin" are more preferable.</p>
									<p>Youkai are weak to spiritual attacks such as names or traditions.</p>

									<h3 class="text-center">Rumia<br><small>Youkai of Twilight</small></h3>
									<hr>
									<img src="./Images/Characters/Rumia.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered">
									<hr>
									<p><b>Ability:</b> Manipulation of darkness<br>
									<b>Threat level:</b> Medium<br>
									<b>Human friendship level:</b> Low<br>
									<b>Main place of activity:</b> Unknown</p>
									<hr>
									<p>Rumia falls into the weaker category of youkai, but she possesses an ability that makes her surroundings dark whether it is night or day.</p>
									<p>The darkness this youkai emits is a magical darkness that renders even torchlight useless, and humans that wander into this darkness have their field of vision reduce to almost nothing.</p>
									<p>It is simple to drag people into the darkness and attack them, but she does not move with a group of other youkai, which is a relief.</p>
									<p>Her appearance is that of a young girl with red eyes and a red ribbon in her blond hair. It is said that she wears dark clothes to blend in with the darkness, but since it is always dark around her this is difficult to confirm.</p>
									<p>Perhaps because she is known as a monster of darkness and is normally feared, people who have directly seen her form discover a young girl and are overcome with relief.</p>
									<p>It is possible that she covers herself in darkness to hide her appearance.</p>
									<p>Also, it is said that her ability to manipulate darkness is only a supporting ability, and that she uses pure power to attack humans.</p>
									<p>Since she looks like what she looks like you cannot tell if she is really strong or not, but it isn't possible to fight against her in the darkness.</p>
									<p>Not being able to see a way out is frightening.</p>
									<hr>
									<h4 class="text-center">Eyewitness Reports</h4>
									<blockquote>
										<p>I saw a large blob of darkness heading towards the forest. It was scary.</p>
										<footer>Hikozaemon</footer>
									</blockquote>
									<p>The large blob of darkness is believed to be this youkai.</p>
									<p>You must not approach it.</p>
									<blockquote>
										<p>Then the large clump of darkness bumped into a tree and looked like it stopped moving for a bit, but it came towards me so I ran away.</p>
										<footer>Hikozaemon</footer>
									</blockquote>
									<p>She most likely bumped into a tree.</p>
									<p>Perhaps she cannot see <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Imagining that, the blob of darkness suddenly becomes amusing.">outside the darkness either.</a></p>
									<blockquote>
										<p>I was too slow in escaping and got caught in the darkness, but I didn't encounter the youkai and slipped right through.</p>
										<footer>Anonymous</footer>
									</blockquote>
									<p>Even if a human enters the darkness, the youkai inside might not notice.</p>
									<p>If that is the case, <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Perhaps she really is stupid.">she most likely cannot see in the darkness she produces.</a></p>
									<hr>
									<h4 class="text-center">Countermeasures</h4>
									<p>Since a human's power can't compare to a youkai's in the first place, it would be impossible to put up a fight within darkness that renders even torchlight useless.</p>
									<p>The best way to deal with this would be to not enter the darkness unless you are very confident in your abilities.</p>
									<p>You should also avoid visiting places where the moonlight doesn't shine at night.</p>
									<p>Rumia may be lurking there.</p>
									<p>Rarely, there are cases of people who have run into Rumia while she was not emitting darkness.</p>
									<p>This was on the night of the new moon.</p>
									<p>This seems to be the most common time when Rumia somehow cannot use her powers, and witness reports flood in.</p>
									<p>There aren't many who have exchanged words with her, but it is doubtful you will be able to talk with her.</p>
									<p>It's probably dangerous to <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Even though she looks young, she eats humans.">attempt a conversation.</a></p>
