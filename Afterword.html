							<p>Ah, hello, it's ZUN as usual.</p>
							<p>Thank you very much for reading Perfect Memento in Strict Sense.</p>
							<p>Even though this compendium of information was set in Gensokyo in name only, its contents cannot be enjoyed if one doesn't have a considerable knowledge of Touhou, but this is usually how it is.</p>
							<p>Despite that, take away the Gensokyo Chronicles from Perfect Memento in Strict Sense and only the front cover and this afterword remains. Saying this is... you know.</p>
							<hr>
							<p>Now then, this time tales and stories were excluded as much as possible, and an objective rather than subjective point of view was the goal.</p>
							<p>Additionally, those who have the most realistic perspectives on things are, as expected, the humans of Gensokyo, with their optimal levels of judgment and reasoning. For that reason, instead of myself, I had Akyuu come forth.</p>
							<hr>
							<p>I've said it so many times now, Gensokyo is idyllic and pastoral, and is a "peace-addled" kind of a world.</p>
							<p>Accordingly, if lives become endangered by something, in most situations, there will be an arranged battle involving humans and youkai.</p>
							<p>If danmaku were thought of as an abstraction of such battles, it is possible to understand why there are a pointless number of attacks, and when thinking about the games, new ideas come easily.</p>
							<p>It would no longer be necessary to force additions to the characteristics of the games, and they would become much more fun to play.</p>
							<hr>
							<p>Despite being a compendium on the games, this book does not touch on the games at all. This is because I want the things relating to the games to complete themselves within the games.</p>
							<p>Practically speaking, things like the contents of this book itself, even if you play the games, are still nothing but utterly unnecessary content.</p>
							<p>Since this was originally a shooting game, to say this is a work based on the worlds that important people of the past created is rather haughty...</p>
							<hr>
							<p>Well then, with regards to the meaning of the information within this book, I made it so that others could enjoy Touhou in addition to the games.</p>
							<p>It's not miscellany, nor completed or conclusive with itself, but just a strange and mysterious book, I guess.</p>
							<p>Anyway, thank you to the illustrators -- Asai, Monoji Tsukuri, Akiâ˜†Eda, TOKIAME, Yagi Shinba and Yamai -- and Ichijinsha, who published this odd book.</p>
							<hr>
							<p>So next time, when considering why or how Akyuu is the 9th generation, I think maybe the monologue could instead be replaced by something interesting and amusing but...</p>
							<p>Well, that's a different story.</p>
