							<p>Perfect Memento in Strict Sense is the Second Official Touhou Fanbook by ZUN. 
							Compared to the first, Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red, it is quite serious in tone; 
							focusing mainly on factual information about the world of Gensokyo.</p>
							<p>Here, we see Gensokyo from the perspective of the (almost) normal human Hieda no Akyuu, 
							a recorder of its history who lives in Gensokyo. Her descriptions show a quite different realm; 
							one where things are described in terms of 'threat levels', 
							and most Youkai are to be feared and avoided rather than laughed at. 
							It deals primarily with the characteristics of the youkai as well as countermeasures 
							that can be taken against them. However, everything recorded are only things within the range of Akyuu's knowledge.</p>
							<p>Since the youkai who were written about have appealed to Akyuu to describe them as being stronger than they actually are, 
							many things are grossly exaggerated from how things actually are. 
							The descriptions also contain Akyuu's own monologues and considerations. 
							Misconceptions can arise if this is not recognized before reading. </p>
