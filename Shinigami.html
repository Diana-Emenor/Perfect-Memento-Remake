									<h4 class="text-center">Characteristics</h4>
									<p>Even though shinigami are not youkai who live in Gensokyo, they do appear in Gensokyo on rare occasions, so they will be given an introduction here.</p>
									<p>Shinigami usually live in Hell, responsible for working at the ministry that determines the life spans of humans, guiding spirits, acting as ferrymen on the Sanzu River, or performing other "tour guide"-type duties.</p>
									<p>While they have the image of greeting humans who have died and taking their souls, in reality, they're the Yama's metaphorical hands and feet, performing any necessary manual labor.</p>
									<p>One characteristic of a shinigami is that they carry enormous scythes with them.</p>
									<p>It is said that this scythe is a symbol of a shinigami's prestige, but in actuality, it is more of a service to the recently deceased.</p>
									<p><a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="It's relatively well-received.">When the deceased first gazes upon a shinigami wielding a giant scythe, they think "there really are such things as shinigami" and then gladly accept their fate.</a></p>

									<h4 class="text-center">Administration of Life Span</h4>
									<p>They record the life spans of living humans, and <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Because this only involves record keeping, even if something deviates from the plans, they do not kill.">if something happens that wasn't in the original plan, a recalculation is performed.</a></p>
									<p>Because this job requires constant recalulations while managing a vast amount of data, shinigami who are cut out for such a job are always being sought after.</p>

									<h4 class="text-center">Receptionist to Hell</h4>
									<p>Because there are spirits that will be unfamiliar to the system in Hell, these guides will explain the details to them and present them with directions to various destinations.</p>
									<p>Shinigami that appear to know about Hell are in charge of this role.</p>

									<h4 class="text-center">Ferryman for the Sanzu River</h4>
									<p>They collect the fare paid by the spirits who come to the Sanzu River, and then have the job of ferrying the spirits to Higan.</p>
									<p>Because this involves hard manual labor away from the office, it's not very popular.</p>
									<p>But because you work by yourself at your own pace, and can meet and talk with all kinds of spirits, those who like this kind of work thoroughly enjoy it.</p>

									<h4 class="text-center">Judicial Clerk</h4>
									<p>Sitting in at the court of the Yama, this work further involves documenting the minutes of the proceedings.</p>
									<p>Only the elite among the shinigami are sought for this position, but the actual work itself is fairly simple.</p>

									<p>A shinigami that ferries a boat across the Sanzu River.</p>
									<p>There are many such shinigami, but <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="She will even do the same for humans from the outside world if she is available.">she is responsible for ferrying most of the souls of the humans in Gensokyo.</a></p>
									<p>For this reason <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Is she slacking off?">she can often be seen in Gensokyo.</a></p>
									<p>Her tall geta and enormous sickle give her an imposing stature.</p>
									<p>Since she's so imposing if you see her while alive, she must be all the more overwhelming after you've died and become a ghost.</p>
									<p>As she loves to talk with her powerful yet pleasant tone, and <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Of course, ghosts can't talk back.">she likely carries a number of one-sided conversations while ferrying souls.</a></p>
									<p>All one can do is sit patiently and endure until they have reached the other side of the river.</p>
									<hr>
									<h4 class="text-center">Ability to Manipulate Distance</h4>
									<p>It's said the width of the Sanzu River changes according to the person that's crossing it.</p>
									<p>Its length is determined by the toll paid to shinigami that ferries it, and larger payments make for shorter trips.</p>
									<p>It is said that the ferriage is paid out of one's own assets. Not the personal assets collected over one's life, but rather the money spent by close friends in behalf of the deceased.</p>
									<p>If by some chance this figure is negative, then the ferry will never reach the other side, and the deceased will likely be thrown overboard into the river.</p>
									<p>Whether one makes it or not is all up to the shinigami.</p>
									<hr>
									<h4 class="text-center">Komachi's Boat on the Sanzu River</h4>
									<p>There is no wind on the Sanzu River, so the ships that cross it have no sails, and must be rowed by hand.</p>
									<p>Compared to her own gaudy dress, her ship is a very austere affair with no decorations.</p>
									<p>If you assume that all the other shinigami's ships are similarly furnished, one might suppose they are provided from Hell.</p>
									<p>As Hell's facilities naturally must expand to accommodate rising populations, it's said Hell is currently experiencing a period of financial difficulty.</p>
									<p>Thus, the shinigami likely have no choice but to use antiquated ferries.</p>
