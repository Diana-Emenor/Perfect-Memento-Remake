									<h3 class="text-center">Main info</h3>
									<hr>
									<p><b>Usual threat level:</b> Low<br>
										<b>Frequency of encounter:</b> Medium<br>
										<b>Variety:</b> Normal<br>
										<b>Places likely to be encountered:</b> Anywhere<br>
										<b>Times likely to be encountered:</b> Anytime </p>
									<hr>
									<h4 class="text-center">Characteristics</h4>
									<p>Therianthropes are those who normally live as humans, but become youkai under certain circumstances.</p>
									<p>When they are living as humans, this does not mean they are pretending to be human. Rather, <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Some mature late in life and have protracted life spans.">they are practically no different from humans.</a></p>
									<p>When they become animals, though, their physical abilities abruptly increase, and they become as powerful as beasts.</p>
									<p>However, many of them retain their memories from being human, so they are often more intelligent than beasts.</p>
									<p>While they rarely attack humans, their habitat range is nearly exact to that of humans, so caution is necessary.</p>
									<p><a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Save for having horns, fangs, and/or tails.">Therianthropy can be hereditary or acquired. In contrast to the hereditary type, which is decided by lineage, acquired therianthropy occurs by being cursed or enchanted or having a magic spell cast upon them.</a></p>
									<p><a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="The resulting animals are often dogs, wolves, cats, pandas or piglets.">Also, the conditions that cause the transformation vary, but the major ones include looking at a full moon, drinking wine, becoming genuinely angry and being doused with water.</a></p>
									<hr>
									<h3 class="text-center">Potential Harm<br><small>Destructive Activity, Sinus Inflammation</small></h3>
									<p>Damage is basically on the low side.</p>
									<p>There are times when agitated therianthropes lay waste to a village, but by large, most therianthropes coexist peaceably with humans, helping with tasks involving manual labor or using their abilities to drive away youkai.</p>
									<p>Befriending them, even as humans, has many advantages, so they are popular youkai.</p>
									<p>However, some people may experience sinus inflammation from their animal hair.</p>
									<hr>
									<h4 class="text-center">Countermeasures</h4>
									<p>Do not show surprise or fear if a neighbor suddenly turns into an animal.</p>
									<p>If one shows more fear than necessary, even a therianthrope will become agitated, putting one in danger.</p>
									<p>At such times, stay calm and attempt to <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Whatever is appropriate for the situation.">engage in natural conversation, such as "My, your fur looks even better than usual today," or "Say, who did your magnificent horns? Not THE Jinbei Echigoya?"</a></p>
									<p>There is absolutely no disadvantage to being friendly with a therianthrope.</p>
									<p>If you suffer from sinus inflammation, tea is moderately effective, so drink it daily.</p>

									<img src="./Images/Characters/Keine Kamishirasawa.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered">
									<hr>
									<p><b>Ability:</b> Power to consume history (when human) and Power to create history (when animal)<br>
										<b>Threat level:</b> Low<br>
										<b>Human friendship level:</b> High<br>

									<p>Rich in knowledge, the wisest of the therianthrope is Keine Kamishirasawa.</p>
									<p>Upon seeing the full moon, she will transform into <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Incidentally, it's an acquired characteristic.">a hakutaku.</a></p>
									<p>A hakutaku is a youkai which appears to virtuous rulers at the beginning of their reign, warning them of future calamities and guiding them on the path of righteousness.</p>
									<p>She can erase history when human, and when she becomes a hakutaku, she can create history.</p>
									<p><a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="The Hieda family's Gensokyo Chronicles is beyond her powers. Thus, it not her history, but ours.">Gensokyo's history is one created by her.</a></p>
									<p>Regarding history, things do not become history merely by happening.</p>
									<p>Things do not become history unless someone records it as history.</p>
									<p>She can fabricate history that didn't happen, or conversely, erase from history incidents which actually did happen.</p>
									<p>History is reality, seen from a single point of view.</p>
									<p>It would not be too much to say the power of the hakutaku is used to create favorable histories for those virtuous rulers.</p>
									<p>She lives in the human village, where <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="She also has close relations with the Hieda family. The vast quantity of information the Hieda family has collected over a thousand years is useful for her lessons.">she runs a temple school and records history there every day.</a></p>
									<p>Such is her profession.</p>
									<hr>
									<h4 class="text-center">Eyewitness Reports</h4>
									<blockquote>
										<p>The temple school lessons are difficult to understand, tedious, and really boring! Can't you do something?</p>
										<footer>Leader's son</footer>
									</blockquote>
									<p>She is not good at entertaining others.</p>
									<blockquote>
										<p>So why don't you come to the temple school, Akyuu?</p>
										<footer>Florist's daughter</footer>
									</blockquote>
									<p>If I were the one teaching, it would certainly be more interesting.</p>
									<p>But a lesson is meaningless if it's merely interesting.</p>
									<blockquote>
										<p>No, that's not what I meant. As a student!</p>
										<footer>Florist's daughter</footer>
									</blockquote>
									<p>Well, I already know everything she teaches...</p>
									<p>Most of the lessons are a summary of my records, anyway...</p>
									<hr>
									<h4 class="text-center">Countermeasures</h4>
									<p>Although she's a little stubborn, since she has no ill will towards humans, there's no need to be afraid.</p>
									<p>However, if you forget your homework, <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Such as a headbutt.">a fearful punishment is waiting.</a></p>
									<p>She is often seen, since she normally lives in the human village.</p>
									<p>At that time, you should greet her.</p>
									<p>It seems that she dislikes people who are discourteous.</p>
									<p>Also, she becomes a hakutaku on the night of the full moon.</p>
									<p>As she has a month of work on which to catch up at this time, she is often on edge.</p>
									<p>Therefore, <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="When she has grown horns, her headbutts are painful.">refrain from visiting her on the night of the full moon.</a></p>
