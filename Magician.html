									<h4 class="text-center">Characteristics</h4>
									<p>There are many types of youkai with extremely varied powers. Some races have a great number that are all categorized under a certain name, while others can be as few as a single member.</p>
									<p>These unique youkai are not called by whatever individual species they may be, but simply "youkai."</p>
									<p>Many of the youkai in Gensokyo fall into this <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="It might be confusing, but youkai as a race is similar to the 'Others' section of a graph. I suppose there are quite a few graphs where 'Others' is the largest category.">"youkai"</a> section.</p>
									<p>Rarely if ever is there any commonality in their appearance, ability, character, danger level, or times and places of activity.</p>
									<p>Just about the only thing in common between youkai is that they attack and prey upon humans.</p>
									<p>There are definitely exceptions, but many fall towards this trend.</p>
									<ul class="list-group">
										<li class="list-group-item"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-asterisk"></span>Youkai have longer lifespans than humans.</li>
										<li class="list-group-item"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-asterisk"></span>Youkai have stronger bodies than humans, so even if they're split into five parts, they heal right away.</li>
										<li class="list-group-item"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-asterisk"></span>Youkai are more easily affected by belief than humans, and as a result spiritual damage can cause fatal wounds.</li>
										<li class="list-group-item"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-asterisk"></span>Youkai generally do not move in groups.</li>
										<li class="list-group-item"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-asterisk"></span>Youkai only think of themselves.</li>
									</ul>
									<p>Youkai are the most dangerous enemies to humans.</p>
									<p>However, since they are rather varied, one must be informed of each of their traits before heading out to exterminate them.</p>
									<hr>
									<h3 class="text-center">Potential Harm<br><small>Kidnapping, Prededation, Livestock Theft, Crop Theft</small></h3>
									<p>Humans have no greater enemy than youkai.</p>
									<p>Youkai attack humans for food.</p>
									<p>However, most do not attack when they are full and satisfied.</p>
									<p>If the human population drops, youkai will face trouble as well.</p>
									<p>They do not eat only humans, but animals, birds, fish, vegetables, fruits, alcohol and other things humans normally eat.</p>
									<p>Still, they consider humans a delicacy above all else.</p>
									<p>They steal crops and livestock as well.</p>
									<p>This is also serious problem.</p>
									<hr>
									<h4 class="text-center">Countermeasures</h4>
									<p>Unless one thoroughly trains in fighting against them, youkai extermination is difficult.</p>
									<p>Youkai have a history of being physically stronger than humans, and trying to fight them may quickly end up as feeding them.</p>
									<p>However, the reason most youkai attack humans is because they need prey.</p>
									<p>That's why one should offer something else to eat in place of themselves.</p>
									<p>Offering a cow will save you from being attacked for a while.</p>
									<p>There are many that have a strong sense of duty, and will befriend those who do not turn against them.</p>
									<p>But exterminating youkai is a different story.</p>
									<p>Humans regularly perform exterminations, but this is a custom passed down from ancestors.</p>
									<p>In Gensokyo, <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="It is said that the balance of Gensokyo will crumble if they do not.">humans must exterminate youkai.</a></p>
									<p>There are those that specialize in youkai extermination.</p>
									<p>For example, the Hakurei shrine maiden is the most well-known specialist.</p>
									<p>In extermination, one does not use weapons that cause physical damage. Weapons with an "origin" are more preferable.</p>
									<p>Youkai are weak to spiritual attacks such as names or traditions.</p>
