									<h4 class="text-center">Characteristics</h4>
									<p>One who has become possessed by magic, such that the one's body itself is powered by magic; this type of youkai is known as a magician.</p>
									<p>Their livelihood revolves around magical research, spending their days thinking about new spells.</p>
									<p>Among youkai, they are the most similar to humans.</p>
									<p>There are two types of magicians: those who were born as magicians and humans who became magicians.</p>
									<p>At the point when they completely become magicians, their <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="There are those who repeatedly cast magic to restore their youth, but...">growth (aging) stops.</a></p>
									<p>Those who were born as magicians, from the start, are only able to use magic, and just like humans, they grow, age, and have a limited lifespan.</p>
									<p>Then, when they learn <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Magic to stop one's growth. It can only be used on oneself.">"abandon temper" magic</a>, they become long-lived, complete magicians.</p>
									<p>In the case of those who were originally human, in continuing their study of magic, it is when they learn <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Magic that allows you to compensate for not eating food via magic power. It can only be used on oneself.">"abandon food" magic</a> that they become magicians.</p>
									<p>After that, it's the same as for normal magicians.</p>
									<p>In any case, becoming a member of the magician race takes quite a bit of time.</p>
									<p>Since they continue to grow old like humans up until that point, in general there are many aged wizards and witches.</p>
									<p>However, in Gensokyo, magical research is more advanced and learning magic is simple.</p>
									<p>Thus, there are more than a few young (childish) magicians in Gensokyo.</p>
									<p>There's no way to tell them apart from humans by their appearance.</p>
									<p>Their bodies are nearly the same as humans', so they are frail in comparison to other youkai.</p>
									<p>They're generally intelligent, studious people with a lot of knowledge, but they tend to be hikikomori and not leave their homes.</p>
									<hr>
									<h3 class="text-center">Potential Harm<br><small>Sacrifice, Theft, Abduction, Fraud</small></h3>
									<p>The most likely cause of harm is theft of livestock.</p>
									<p>Living livestock is necessary for large-scale magic, and it seems there is a serious livestock shortage among magicians.</p>
									<p>In addition, they often steal food and drink (especially liquor), and curios such as moon rocks.</p>
									<p>At worst, they might even <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Sometimes the children become the magicians' apprentices.">steal children.</a></p>
									<p>Also, they can use magic which is similar to sleight of hand and commit fraud.</p>
									<p>Perhaps performing magic requires money, but they will take any means necessary to raise funds.</p>
									<p>Be particularly cautious if you see someone selling shady magic props on the roadside.</p>
									<hr>
									<h4 class="text-center">Countermeasures</h4>
									<p>The most important thing is to not trust magicians.</p>
									<p>Fortunately, their bodies are only about as strong as that of an ordinary human, so running away is simple.</p>
									<p>A magician who is properly prepared is so strong that they can take on any kind of youkai.</p>
									<p>However, they are weak to surprise attacks, and are not good at close combat or lengthy conflicts.</p>
									<p>The most fundamental thing is to be careful not to fall into a magician's trap, which will not happen without entering their territory.</p>
									<p>If you happen to do so, your best options are either to immediately run away or to boldly approach them.</p>

									<p>The magician that appears in front of crowds during festivals and displays her performances with her dolls would be Alice Margatroid.</p>
									<p>She is an artistic magician who manipulates dolls with magic and makes it appear as if they were alive.</p>
									<p>She has blond hair and pale skin, looking very much like a doll herself.</p>
									<p>She is the type of magician that was originally human and became one through training.</p>
									<p>Because of this, she is very understanding of humans.</p>
									<p>However, her history as a magician is short, and she is a novice.</p>
									<p>She still eats and sleeps and does everything a human would, despite not needing to do so.</p>
									<p>She usually lives in a cozy western house in the Forest of Magic.</p>
									<p>If you happen to wander into the Forest of Magic, lose your way and end up at her house, it is said that she will cheerfully allow you to stay the night.</p>
									<p>However, while she says that, all she does is research magic and control her dolls without really conversing, which is unsettling, <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="However, running into the Forest of Magic at night is also scary, so you would have no choice but to bear with it.">so it seems one would want to run away as soon as possible.</a></p>
									<hr>
									<h4 class="text-center">Ability</h4>
									<p>Doll manipulation magic is magic that makes it seem as if the dolls were alive.</p>
									<p>It is not magic that gives life to the dolls, but allows the user to control them with magical strings, so long distance manipulation is very difficult.</p>
									<p>However, dolls cannot defy orders or harm their user.</p>
									<p>The dolls she uses are not all special dolls; there are many normal dolls.</p>
									<p>Most of them were made by her.</p>
									<p>By attaching magical threads to her handmade dolls, <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="She is very dexterous. However, magical threads are not controlled by the hands, but by magic.">she manipulates them freely.</a></p>
									<hr>
									<h4 class="text-center">Daily Life</h4>
									<p>It is said that cooking, laundry, cleaning and other household chores are mostly done by her dolls.</p>
									<p>It seems convenient at first, but the dolls are not moving by themselves, so she always has her hands full concentrating.</p>
									<p>It is said that she can make her dolls move in nearly any way a human can.</p>
									<p>She can even have her dolls control other dolls.</p>
									<p>However, there is one thing she does not have her dolls do.</p>
									<p>That is creating dolls.</p>
									<p>It seems to be the only thing she does by her own hands.</p>
									<hr>
									<h4 class="text-center">Eyewitness Reports</h4>
									<blockquote>
										<p>She said that she controls all the dolls herself, but that sounds like a whopper.</p>
										<footer>Marisa Kirisame</footer>
									</blockquote>
									<p>I believe people who have seen her would understand, but she controls several dolls and makes each one perform separate actions, at times makes them cooperate, and the dolls move completely asynchronously.</p>
									<p>It really does not seem like she is controlling them, but...</p>
									<blockquote>
										<p>There were a large number of dolls floating down the river. Wasn't that the work of a doll youkai?</p>
										<footer>Anonymous</footer>
									</blockquote>
									<p>That might be <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="The act of transferring misfortune and impurity onto dolls and floating them down a river. Lately, it is believed to cause pollution so this practice has waned.">nagashi-bina.</a></p>
									<blockquote>
										<p>A while ago, I saw a weird doll with another doll inside it. Isn't that the work of a doll youkai?</p>
										<footer>Reimu Hakurei</footer>
									</blockquote>
									<p>That's a matryoshka doll.</p>
									<hr>
									<h4 class="text-center">Countermeasures</h4>
									<p>Since she was originally human, she most likely rarely attacks humans.</p>
									<p>However, she unexpectedly enjoys battles, and if you challenge her she will gladly accept.</p>
									<p>Since she is accompanied by her dolls, if you challenge her, you will be forced into a battle highly outnumbered.</p>
									<p>Unless you are very confident in your abilities, a difficult battle is inevitable.</p>
									<p>Also, attempting to destroy her dolls is meaningless, like pouring water over a hot stone.</p>
									<p>And at times, she makes her dolls explode.</p>
									<p>You must not attack the dolls.</p>
									<p>She may seem like a youkai that is difficult to deal with, but she has a weak point.</p>
									<p>That is Alice herself.</p>
									<p>She has her hands full manipulating the dolls, so her movements are sluggish and her fighting ability is low.</p>
									<p>If you are ever in a match with her, aim for her directly.</p>

									<h3 class="text-center">Patchouli Knowledge<br><small>Unmoving Great Library</small></h3>
									<hr>
									<img src="./Images/Characters/Patchouli Knowledge.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered">
									<hr>
									<p><b>Ability:</b> Use of magic (mainly elemental)<br>
										<b>Threat level:</b> Medium<br>
										<b>Human friendship level:</b> Normal<br>
										<b>Main place of activity:</b> Scarlet Devil Mansion</p>
									<hr>
									<p>Patchouli Knowledge is a magician known as the brains of the Scarlet Devil Mansion, the manor where devils live.</p>
									<p>It is her role to <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="At the same time, it is her role to cause problems as well.">resolve problems that occur there.</a></p>
									<p>She has long hair, but otherwise her appearance is indistinguishable from a human's.</p>
									<p>She is purely a magician, and it is said she has lived for over a hundred years.</p>
									<p>Astonishingly, it is also said she has spent most of those hundred years reading books.</p>
									<p>She is proficient in various types of magic and eagerly researches new spells.</p>
									<p>Whenever she devises a new spell, she inscribes it into a magic book, expanding the library.</p>
									<p>It's unknown when exactly she settled into the Scarlet Devil Mansion, but judging by the size of the library, it must have been a considerable time ago.</p>
									<hr>
									<h4 class="text-center">Ability</h4>
									<p>She is a magician's magician, able to cast various sorts of magic.</p>
									<p>She mainly uses elemental magic.</p>
									<p>Elemental magic borrows on the power of fairies and spirits to result in an output greatly exceeding the small input.</p>
									<p>Elemental magic is comprised of seven varieties: "wood," for life and awakening; "fire," for change and movement; "earth," for foundation and immobility; "metal," for wealth and abundance; "water," for silence and purification; "sun," for activity and offense; "moon," for passivity and defense.</p>
									<p>While being able to use magic from all these elements, the surprising part is that it seems she is able to cast spells that combine two or more elements.</p>
									<p>Moreover, her variations are extraordinarily abundant. She can combine fire and wood to increase her power, or combine fire and earth to cover her weaknesses, and much more.</p>
									<hr>
									<h4 class="text-center">Grimoires and the Great Library</h4>
									<p>Grimoires, or magic books, are not simply books, but are magical items with magic power sealed inside.</p>
									<p>Their contents are not simply directions on how to cast magic, but the secret keys to the use of magic itself.</p>
									<p>In theory, anyone could cast a spell if they had the appropriate magic book, but without finding the key inside, it would not be possible to understand what is written within.</p>
									<p>One cannot find the key if they do not possess equal or greater skill than the person who wrote the grimoire.</p>
									<p>The letters written in the book are not the system used by humans, but are said to be divine-era hiragana, or perhaps the original Japanese writing system.</p>
									<p>There is a great library beneath the Scarlet Devil Mansion filled with veritable mountains of magic books.</p>
									<p>There are many magic books that she has written, as well as many that no one has been able to read.</p>
									<p>The library holds a great many books besides magic books, as well.</p>
									<p>Most of this material consists of books from <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Gensokyo's books are primarily handwritten. There are few properly bound and published books.">the outside world.</a></p>
									<hr>
									<h4 class="text-center">Eyewitness Reports</h4>
									<blockquote>
										<p>That library reeks of mold</p>
										<footer>Marisa Kirisame</footer>
									</blockquote>
									<p>Since Japan is quite humid, archives are typically built in well-ventilated areas.</p>
									<p>Since the Scarlet Devil Mansion is a Western-style building, it may not have been made with Japanese climates in mind.</p>
									<blockquote>
										<p>There's the occasional book that is readable sometimes.</p>
										<footer>Reimu Hakurei</footer>
									</blockquote>
									<p>One can read a book from the outside world just like any other book.</p>
									<p>I would also like to try reading one.</p>
									<hr>
									<h4 class="text-center">Countermeasures</h4>
									<p>The characteristic of elemental magic is to create great effects from a small amount of power, but there are flaws to this approach.</p>
									<p>hat is because each element has its own weak point.</p>
									<p>This applies to her magic as well.</p>
									<p>If by some chance you end up in a battle with her, you must stay alert to which element of magic she is using while fighting her.</p>
									<p>But since she seldom leaves the Scarlet Devil Mansion, battles with her are extremely rare.</p>
									<p>As long as you do not break into it, there will be no chance of fighting her.</p>
									<p>In addition, her physical condition is poorer than that of a human's.</p>
									<p><a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="As is characteristic for a magician, she can speak extremely quickly in a low voice. It's suffocating to watch her speak so quickly even with asthma.">Since she is asthmatic</a>, she can't exert herself too much, lest it becomes difficult to breathe.</p>
									<p>This places her in an unusual category among youkai.</p>
