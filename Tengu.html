									<h4 class="text-center">Characteristics</h4>
									<p>Deified youkai who live on the mountain.</p>
									<p>These extremely well-known youkai have existed since ancient times, predating even Gensokyo, and formed a peculiar society where they lead their reclusive lifestyles.</p>
									<p>There are various types of tengu: the tengu boss, Tenma; the management types, Great tengu; the nimble information corps, Crow tengu; the ones who specialize in business work, Hanataka tengu; the mountain's defense force, White Wolf tengu; and the printers, Yamabushi tengu.</p>
									<p>In general, they look the same as humans, but there are extremely large tengu such as the Great tengu, and extremely proud ones such as the Hanataka tengu, who always have their nose in the air.</p>
									<p>As can be seen from their advanced civilization, tengu are far more intelligent than humans, and are very social.</p>
									<p>On an individual basis, they have very strong physical and sorcerous abilities that compare favorably to any youkai in Gensokyo.</p>
									<p>In particular, they can fly extremely fast, and <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Maybe a vampire could.">there are few, if any, who can match their speed.</a></p>
									<p>One characteristic of tengu is that they are generally cheerful, heavy drinkers.</p>
									<p>When they drink sake, they don't hold back in terms of quantity. It's said that as a greeting, they'll drink 18 liters of sake in one gulp.</p>
									<p>They also have a strong sense of community, and if one of their friends are attacked, they'll certainly react with hostility.</p>
									<p>If an intruder appears on the mountain, they'll quickly show up in force to remove them, which is a characteristic not seen in other youkai.</p>
									<p>Usually, if there's an incident, they'll show up with their amazing speed, take a photograph and turn it into an article, then print and publish it.</p>
									<hr>
									<h3 class="text-center">Potential Harm<br><small>Sudden Gusts, Rumormongering, Paparazzi Photography, etc.</small></h3>
									<p>The wind that occurs in the wake of a tengu is strong enough to send a child flying.</p>
									<p>It doesn't happen often, but it's said that if you anger a tengu, you'll be annihilated by a tornado.</p>
									<p>What's even more frightening is that they'll spread half-truths and weird rumors.</p>
									<p>There are cases where the tengus' rumors will literally become the wind's rumors that they even reached human ears.</p>
									<p>Thereby, it becomes difficult to properly notify the village otherwise.</p>
									<p>Because this is something against which there is no complete defense, there is nothing more dreadful than this.</p>
									<hr>
									<h4 class="text-center">Countermeasures</h4>
									<p>First, you must not go to the mountain unprepared.</p>
									<p>Tengu strongly detest trespassers on their territory.</p>
									<p>There's honestly no way to defend against the rumors on the wind, so even if they circulate strange rumors, all you can do is live your life assuming that other people will think "That's just a rumor."</p>
									<p>Even if the rumors are complete lies, others will think "If it's 'that person' then maybe...", and will make you feel guily regardless.</p>
									<p>Also, the paparazzi photography is fearsome, <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="To be honest, at the moment there is no way to compete with tengu.">but you just have to bear with it.</a></p>

									<h3 class="text-center">Aya Shameimaru<br><small>Traditional Reporter of Fantasy</small></h3>
									<hr>
									<img src="./Images/Characters/Aya Shameimaru.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered">
									<hr>
									<p><b>Ability:</b> Manipulation of Wind<br>
										<b>Threat level:</b> High<br>
										<b>Human friendship level:</b> Normal<br>
										<b>Main place of activity:</b> Mountain of Youkai</p>
									<hr>
									<p>Aya Shameimaru is a crow tengu who is considered to be quite fast, even among other tengu.</p>
									<p>She flies around Gensokyo with her camera in one hand, and when she finds an interesting event, she leaves with a few photographs.</p>
									<p>Though she is a crow tengu, she looks basically the same as any human.</p>
									<p>She is never seen without her fan, her camera or her bunkacho.</p>
									<p>Her fan is a tool that allows her to summon the wind. One sweep of the fan can blow over a house, two sweeps can blow over a large tree and three sweeps can cause a traveler's cloak to fly away.</p>
									<p>Her camera is another powerful tengu weapon which <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="It also has an amazing shutter speed.">can capture a moment in time and display it as a picture.</a></p>
									<p>The photographs she takes are later used for her newspaper articles.</p>
									<p>Her bunkacho is a tengu notebook where she writes down material she thinks could make interesting articles.</p>
									<p>It is filled with innumerable photographs and <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="It's said her handwriting is unexpectedly cute even though she's a tengu.">handwritten notes.</a></p>
									<p>Her ability to manipulate the wind is a very straightforward ability that allows her to create and suddenly stop winds, as well as create tornadoes.</p>
									<hr>
									<h4 class="text-center">Bunbunmaru Newspaper</h4>
									<p><a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="There are many in tengu society who create newspapers on their own. As a result, the newspapers tend to be biased.">The newspaper that she writes articles based on the information she gathers is the Bunbunmaru Newspaper.</a></p>
									<p>She normally writes about the unusual events caused by females in Gensokyo.</p>
									<p>Currently, even humans and non-tengu youkai can subscribe to it.</p>
									<p>However, it has no set publication period, and she may have five issues in a month during a busy period.</p>
									<p>As the volume of articles in one newspaper is small, it's not very useful for gathering information.</p>
									<p>This is rather the sort of newspaper that is more suited for a human or youkai <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="It is popular in cafes.">that wishes to whittle away a lazy afternoon perusing its pages while sipping a cup of tea.</a></p>
									<hr>
									<h4 class="text-center">Eyewitness Reports</h4>
									<blockquote>
										<p>I have so many of her papers piled up, I don't know what to do with them. Really. Even though I'm not a subscriber.</p>
										<footer>Reimu Hakurei</footer>
									</blockquote>
									<p>She delivers a mountain of extras.</p>
									<p>To tell the truth, I also have a lot of extras piling up.</p>
									<blockquote>
										<p>It's such a bother how the crows gather around when we throw out our garbage.</p>
										<footer>Sakuya Izayoi</footer>
									</blockquote>
									<p>Those aren't tengu, but normal crows.</p>
									<hr>
									<h4 class="text-center">Countermeasures</h4>
									<p>The pen is mightier than the sword.</p>
									<p>If they're written up in her newspaper, even the mightiest youkai are no match for her.</p>
									<p>Every inhabitant of Gensokyo dislikes her presence, with that fearsome weapon, the "newspaper", along with her natural strength.</p>
									<p>She will come politely asking interviews of humans and youkai alike if she sees them worth writing an article about, but will forcefully drive away any who interfere.</p>
									<p>She is generally the sort of youkai one does not wish to oppose, but if one somehow manages to cross her, her strength is practically unrivaled.</p>
									<p>You likely won't have anything to lose by cooperating with her news-gathering.</p>
