									<hr>
									<h4 class="text-center">Characteristics</h4>
									<p>The supreme god of Gensokyo.</p>
									<p>This god is worshipped by all living creatures, including humans and youkai.</p>
									<p><a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="As an aside, the dragon can go anywhere, regardless of the Great Border. It is said that it can move itself freely even to the outside world, the Netherworld or Hell.">It is believed to live in the ocean, or the sky, or in the rain</a>, but few have been able to confirm this.</p>
									<p>It is said that a dragon looks like a serpent with hands and horns, that it is thicker than a great tree thousands of years old, and so long that it blocks out the sky.</p>
									<p>Its cry rends the heavens and causes thunderstorms.</p>
									<p>When it stirs, mountains crumble and earthquakes occur.</p>
									<p>Who knows what would happen to Gensokyo if something were to invoke its wrath.</p>
									<p>However, the dragon god is also Gensokyo's god of creation.</p>
									<p>It is thanks to the dragon that the rain falls, the rivers flow and that Gensokyo is enveloped in a verdant green.</p>
									<p>It rarely appears, and is said to show up only in Gensokyo's greatest times of need, blocking out the sky.</p>
									<p>Proof of its appearances are the rainbows and rivers that manifest in its wake.</p>
									<hr>
									<h4 class="text-center">The Dragon at the Creation of the Great Hakurei Barrier</h4>
									<p>The last time the dragon appeared in Gensokyo was when the Great Hakurei Barrier was created.</p>
									<p>The sky was rent with constant thunder, the land was engulfed in a flood that threatened to submerge it, and for an instant, the skies were completely dark.</p>
									<p>The youkai sages staked their existence on pledging eternal peace to the dragon, and in an instant the waters drew back, the sky was torn asunder, and light was returned to the heavens.</p>
									<p>Since then, there has been a statue enshrining the dragon at the center of the human village, which is worshiped every day.</p>
									<hr>
									<h4 class="text-center">The Dragon God's Statue</h4>
									<p>It's said the dragon god's statue in the human village is an amazing artifact that can tell you what the day's weather will be with the color of its eyes.</p>
									<p>When its eyes are white, it will be sunny. When they're blue, it will rain. When they're grey, it will be cloudy. <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="It should be convenient, or the humans wouldn't come to worship it. It is said that the kappa who the chiseled the statue thought so and sneaked a forecasting device into the statue.">It's very convenient.</a></p>
									<p>But beware when the eyes turn red.</p>
									<p>Since this is the color reserved for indeterminate predictions, it appears whenever something truly strange is happening in Gensokyo.</p>
									<p>In many cases, it was due to youkai-related incidents.</p>
									<p>Incidentally, this weather forecast is correct 70% of the time.</p>
								</div>
								<div id="Kappa" class="tab-pane fade text-justify">
									<h3 class="text-center">Kappa<br><small>The Craftsman Youkai of the Water</small></h3>
									<hr>
									<p><b>Usual threat level:</b> Average<br>
										<b>Frequency of encounter:</b> Low<br>
										<b>Variety:</b> Low<br>
										<b>Places likely to be encountered:</b> Youkai Mountain<br>
										<b>Times likely to be encountered:</b> Anytime</p>
									<hr>
									<h4 class="text-center">Characteristics</h4>
									<p>These are youkai who dwell in the river near Youkai Mountain.</p>
									<p>They are technologically-gifted youkai that produce various tools with skillful hands.</p>
									<p>Similar to the tengu, they have built their own society, more advanced than us humans.</p>
									<p>Their appearance is human, but they have turtle shells covering their backs, and plates covering their heads.</p>
									<p>Swimming is their forte, and in the water they can move faster than a fish, but on dry land there is no major difference in abilities compared to a human's.</p>
									<p>Their fighting skills are also comparatively low, so they seldom show themselves to humans.</p>
									<p>Furthermore, since they run away when they notice humans, their way of life is shrouded in mystery.</p>
									<p>When they are spotted, it is just the occasional foolish kappa that has been washed down the river.</p>
									<hr>
									<h4 class="text-center">The Tools of the Kappa</h4>
									<p>The tools created by the kappa and the tools of the outer world are treasured as the two greatest varieties in Gensokyo today.</p>
									<p>However, it is unknown how to use most of the tools.</p>
									<p>The photographing devices used by the tengu are a good example of this.</p>
									<p>Even when the button is pressed, it remains silent for some reason.</p>
									<p>Others are the clock that somehow tells time correctly, and a device capable of talking to people over great distances.</p>
									<p>The mountain society is said to <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="It is also said that they are created by copying the devices from the outside world, but their waterproofing is outstanding.">have become very advanced with these various devices,</a> including ones for transmitting images to other places, as well as receiving them.</p>
									<hr>
									<h4 class="text-center">The Kappa's Lifestyle</h4>
									<p>Swimming may be the kappa's strong point, but it is not as if they actually live in the water.</p>
									<p>Usually they live on land, where they also make their tools.</p>
									<p>If an enemy approaches they dive into the water and hide.</p>
									<p>However, <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="They can hold their breath for several hours.">while they can stay under water longer than a human,</a> they cannot remain there forever. They must surface for air eventually.</p>
									<p>Kappa clothing is very water-resistant, so is possible to wear it into the water, and it won't interfere while swimming.</p>
								</div>
								<div id="Celestials" class="tab-pane fade text-justify">
									<h3 class="text-center">Celestials<br><small>The Most Carefree Humans</small></h3>
									<hr>
									<p><b>Usual threat level:</b> Very Low<br>
										<b>Frequency of encounter:</b> Very Low<br>
										<b>Variety:</b> Normal<br>
										<b>Places likely to be encountered:</b> Unknown<br>
										<b>Times likely to be encountered:</b> Unknown</p>
									<hr>
									<h4 class="text-center">Characteristics</h4>
									<p>Humans that live in Heaven.</p>
									<p>They live forever in Heaven, separated from the world of daily cares, and even from the circle of transmigration.</p>
									<p>As they are bright and carefree, and love song, dance and fishing, they spend their days on activities such as listening to music, fishing and playing go.</p>
									<p>Celestials are hermits who have long pursued ascetic knowledge, but they can be divided into <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="It's said one would need to pursue enlightenment for hundreds, or thousands, of years.">those who have achieved immortality and ascended to heaven</a>, and those who have attained enlightenment and entered Nirvana after death.</p>
									<p>The former have physical bodies, so they can appear on earth with ease, but the latter cannot descend from Heaven without borrowing somebody's body.</p>
									<p>Sometimes they descend to earth, say absurd things that confound normal humans, and return to Heaven.</p>
									<p>A celestial's body is like poison to youkai, and as a result, youkai almost never attack celestials, so they have nothing to fear on earth.</p>
									<p>Even the most ferocious of beasts would be tamed if they only held out their hand.</p>
									<p>They are also able to ride on clouds, and the divine appearance this gives them is almost frightening.</p>
									<hr>
									<h4 class="text-center">Conditions for Becoming a Celestial</h4>
									<p>Celestials spend their days listening to music, fishing, and playing go, never bothered with the need to do work, and always able to eat the highest quality food.</p>
									<p>Certainly, <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Of course, I'd like to, as well.">no small number of people would like to live their dream-like lifestyle.</a></p>
									<p>However, to become a celestial, humans must free themselves of worldly desires.</p>
									<p>In other words, the first requirement is certainly to not be the sort of person who would yearn for such a life.</p>
									<p>Likely, most people would not meet this requirement.</p>
									<hr>
									<h4 class="text-center">The World of the Celestials</h4>
									<p>The celestial world is said to exist above the clouds, but in reality this is not the case.</p>
									<p>It actually exists far above the Netherworld.</p>
									<p>The dead are naturally able to go there, but it's also possible for living people to visit.</p>
									<p>This is because throwing away all desires includes freeing oneself of the desire to live, in which case one essentially becomes a living dead.</p>
								</div>
								<div id="Hermits" class="tab-pane fade text-justify">
									<h3 class="text-center">Hermits<br><small>Somewhat Peculiar Humans</small></h3>
									<hr>
									<p><b>Usual threat level:</b> Very Low<br>
										<b>Frequency of encounter:</b> Low<br>
										<b>Variety:</b> Average<br>
										<b>Places likely to be encountered:</b> Unknown<br>
										<b>Times likely to be encountered:</b> Unknown</p>
									<hr>
									<h4 class="text-center">Characteristics</h4>
									<p>Training according to the principles of bhavana, these persons have acquired superhuman-like abilities.</p>
									<p>However, they have not completely cast aside all of their worldly desires, rather, they are separated from the drudgeries of needing to work, and now reside in Gensokyo.</p>
									<p>Their age and longevity may be in the hundreds or even thousands of years, but they are not immortal.</p>
									<p>If they become carelessly negligent in the pursuit of bhavana, their bodies will immediately decay into ashes.</p>
									<p>Unlike celestials, which are poisonous to youkai, hermits are a delicacy to youkai.</p>
									<p>A youkai who consumes a hermit may be promoted to a higher rank or ascend to a higher form.</p>
									<p>Furthermore, if an ordinary animal consumes the flesh of a hermit, they will become a beast.</p>
									<p>In other words, to be a hermit is to become the target of countless youkai.</p>
									<p>As if that weren't enough, hermits are always beset by misfortune, <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="The simple act of living is a sin. As the weight of that sin is as great as the lifespan, it is necessary to perform pious acts to compensate for them.">the worst of which is that about once every hundred years, an assassin will come from Hell.</a></p>
									<p>During this time, if they are even a little careless in their pursuit of bhavana, and their powers weaken even a little, they will be unable to repel the threat and will fall into Hell.</p>
									<p>It's difficult to continue living as a hermit, to say nothing of attempting to become a celestial.</p>
									<p>As there are many kinds of humans that make up this group, it can be expected that most of them are a little peculiar.</p>
									<p>Their everyday habits stand out from the norm, and people who don't understand their situation will mutter hostilities among themselves, eventually leading the hermits to leave from the human village.</p>
									<p>However, the bonds of fellowship between hermits is profound, as soon as a new candidate for hermitry appears, <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="They are also entrusted with miscellaneous tasks.">he is taken in as a disciple, and in a manner of speaking, will be taken care of until he can stand on his own.</a></p>
									<hr>
									<h4 class="text-center">Everyday Life of Hermits</h4>
									<p>Their everyday life is extremely modest and frugal, only eating the absolute minimum amount of food needed to live. <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Like squirrels.">On the first day of the month, they will nibble the fruits and nuts from various trees and, in this way, survive.</a></p>
									<p>Furthermore, upon reaching the age of 500, food of any kind is unnecessary, and simply ingesting fog or haze will be enough.</p>
									<p>From the moment they wake up, <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="They will use reading techniques that rotate the sutras to be recited.">they turn towards the sunrise and will recite sutras countless thousands of times</a>, only briefly during the day will they freely go out, as the sun sets, they will once again be engaged in reciting sutras.</p>
									<hr>
									<h4 class="text-center">Abilities of Hermits</h4>
									<p>These hermits who are the most alluring of humans to youkai naturally possess comparable levels of power.</p>
									<p>Also, there are many situations of youkai exterminators who, in the course of their work, became hermits.</p>
									<p>Because their physical bodies are aged, they may appear to be extremely fragile or vulnerable, but there are many of them take care of themselves with natural cures, and it is said that their bodies are tougher than steel.</p>
									<p>Furthermore, they are able to learn various kinds of sorcery.</p>
									<p>If they see something dangerous approaching a human, they will immediately come to the aid of the person and will display the utmost kindness.</p>

									<h3 class="text-center">Yaoyorozu no Kami (The Eight Million Gods)<br><small>A Saturation of Gods</small></h3>
									<hr>
									<p><b>Usual threat level:</b> Low<br>
										<b>Frequency of encounter:</b> High<br>
										<b>Variety:</b> High<br>
										<b>Places likely to be encountered:</b> Anywhere<br>
										<b>Times likely to be encountered:</b> Anytime</p>
									<hr>
									<h4 class="text-center">Characteristics</h4>
									<p>These are the gods that are found everywhere and have an especially deep relationship with humans.</p>
									<p>Here, "eight million" is taken in its sense of "myriads"; a true count would probably be much higher.</p>
									<p>Since they're formless, you can't touch or converse with them.</p>
									<p>As for what their true forms are, they were in the form of all things before they were given names.</p>
									<p>Even when given a name, the gods' effects are faintly perceptible.</p>
									<p>These gods inhabit many different objects, but don't inhabit anything without a physical form.</p>
									<p>They run the full gamut from the fearful to the friendly, from the noble to the humble, and so on.</p>
									<p><a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="It is also true that the god's grade is said to increase through use as well.">It's said that tools that host gods increase in utility according to the level of the inhabiting spirit.</a></p>
									<hr>
									<h4 class="text-center">Rites for the Spirit Inhabiting a Tool</h4>
									<p>When you buy a new tool, <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Don't forget to be respectful towards the god.">you should pray to its spirit, and investigate ways to keep it from breaking.</a></p>
									<p>If it breaks at this early stage, it's said to be inhabited by the curse god of early failure.</p>
									<p>If you tell the shopkeeper about it, they may be able to exorcise the spirit.</p>
									<p>Try using it every day, cleaning it well and treating it carefully.</p>
									<p>If you do this, the god's mood will improve.</p>
									<p>If it breaks and you buy a replacement, the spirit will become angry, and you will become cursed.</p>
									<p>To avoid this, you must hold a proper memorial and get rid of it.</p>
									<p>If you neglect to do so, the spirit may become a tsukumogami and begin to move on its own and bring evil to its owner.</p>
									<hr>
									<h4 class="text-center">Tsukumogami</h4>
									<p>The spirit of a tool that's used continuously for a long period of time may take on the thoughts of its owner and gradually attain divinity.</p>
									<p>If it's cast aside without a proper memorial, the god may not be able to return to normal, but into a tsukumogami, and it may move on its own in an attempt to inflict harm on its former owner.</p>
									<p>These spirits are more like youkai than gods, and can wreak real havoc against people, lacking a single redeeming feature.</p>
									<p>Please remember to properly memorialize well-used tools.</p>
								</div>
								<div id="Divine_Spirit" class="tab-pane fade text-justify">
									<h3 class="text-center">Divine Spirit<br><small>Apparitions of the Gods</small></h3>
									<hr>
									<p><b>Usual threat level:</b> Very Low<br>
										<b>Frequency of encounter:</b> Very Low<br>
										<b>Variety:</b> Unknown<br>
										<b>Places likely to be encountered:</b> Shrines<br>
										<b>Times likely to be encountered:</b> Unknown</p>
									<hr>
									<h4 class="text-center">Characteristics</h4>
									<p>Among the dead, those who are revered as gods are called divine spirits. There are those who lived as gods, and also those who, after death, ascended to godhood.</p>
									<p>Having no connection to the 8 million gods, these will not die even after a memorial service, but will simply extinguish.</p>
									<p>Divine spirits, not possessing a body, usually live in a Shinto shrine or in a smaller shrine, and only during festivals will emerge to ride and have a good time on a portable Shinto shrine, seeing humans in this state will put them at ease.</p>
									<p>The powers of the divine spirits come from the power of faith. <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Because the monetary offerings will increase.">If they have many believers, they will have a greater influence on humans and youkai, and the shrine will also become greater.</a></p>
									<p>Conversely, when faith decreases, their powers of influence will become weaker, and their shrine will begin to decline.</p>
									<p>Basically this is relying on the actions of others.</p>
									<hr>
									<h4 class="text-center">Shrine Maidens</h4>
									<p>There is a considerable lack of spirits in a shrine, so revealing their forms to people is something that mostly never happens.</p>
									<p>They speak so faintly that ordinary humans can't hear them.</p>
									<p>For this reason, those who carry the duty of facilitating communication are shrine maidens.</p>
									<p>Shrine maidens can, <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Such as dancing, drinking alcohol, dancing while drinking alcohol and various other methods.">utilizing peculiar methods</a>, hear the words of the divine spirits and communicate this to the people.</p>
									<hr>
									<h4 class="text-center">Shrines</h4>
									<p>Shrines are not constructed by divine spirits, but by humans.</p>
									<p>If the shrine is built for an existing diving spirit, then that spirit will naturally take lodging in it.</p>
									<p>However, from here on in, there is a problem.</p>
									<p>Simply because it is a place for divine spirits, a shrine looks no different from any ordinary building.</p>
									<p>If many people come to the shrine to worship the divine spirit, it will begin to gain power from being worshipped by so many for the first time.</p>
									<p>As the number of visiting worshippers increases, expansions and renovations to to the shrine become an important matter, and a great amount of money will become necessary.</p>
									<p>In other words, the goal of a shrine is to expend all acquired monetary offerings from the visiting worshippers</p>
