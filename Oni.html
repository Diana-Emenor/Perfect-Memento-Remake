									<h4 class="text-center">Characteristics</h4>
									<!-- <p>The Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) (pronounced as o äni) was initially designed as the intelligence service branch of the UNSC Navy.</p> -->
									<p>They are the strongest enemies of humans in Gensokyo.</p>
									<p>Their livelihood is kidnapping humans, and with their high levels of physical and magical strength, they are the strongest beings in Gensokyo.</p>
									<p>In antiquity, they lived on Youkai Mountain and, employing the tengu as servants, <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="It is said that the present society of tengu is built upon the vestiges of the original oni society.">built up an oni society.</a></p>
									<p>From then on at regular fixed intervals, they would kidnap humans, and thus threaten the livelihood of the villages.</p>
									<p>However, since several hundred years ago, the number of oni has decreased little by little, and from the time the great barrier was built, they no longer show themselves anywhere in Gensokyo.</p>
									<p>Just as few humans were trying to exterminate them, they were none too pleased with the way in which the world of Gensokyo had become so carefree, and they simply went to a different world. <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="In Gensokyo, we call where they went the Land of the Oni. Possibly Hell.">No one knows where this world is, and since then, contact of any kind with the oni has ceased.</a></p>
									<p>Oni can have a wide variety of physiques, from huge builds all the way down to short and petite.</p>
									<p>But all of them have horns, and some also have fangs.</p>
									<p>A few have arms longer than humans with slouched postures.</p>
									<p>Their personalities can range from cheerful to ferocious, and they can suddenly become belligerent with those they dislike. However, once they recognize someone as a friend, then their feelings will become intensely warm, and the idea of betraying or double-crossing you would become inconceivable.</p>
									<p>What they detest the most are gossiping, cowardice, malice or unfairness.</p>
									<p>Always honoring their promises, they can think of no other way to behave than to be fair and square.</p>
									<p>There are no youkai who are as forthright as the oni.</p>
									<p>Also, their emotional and mental discipline is considerably strong, and very few oni are not well-versed in the principles of Zen.</p>
									<p>Also, they love alcohol like no other being, and can consume vast quantities. If you were to become drunk with them and then lie down to sleep, no matter what happens you won't wake up.</p>
									<hr>
									<h3 class="text-center">Potential Harm<br><small>Abduction</small></h3>
									<p>Since times fairly long ago, humans have been tormented by the oni.</p>
									<p>Occasionally descending from the mountain, kidnapping humans and making off with sake, the oni threatened their day-to-day life.</p>
									<p>And because the humans couldn't stay silent and do nothing, an oni extermination specialist was trained or summoned at fixed intervals to go exterminate the oni.</p>
									<p>When that happened, marvelous tools and implements were taken from the oni society after they have been beaten.</p>
									<p>Oni and humans, through human kidnappings and oni exterminations, might have possibly built up a relationship of mutual trust.</p>
									<hr>
									<h4 class="text-center">Countermeasures</h4>
									<p>Because the oni have disappeared from Gensokyo, at the present time, there are no oni extermination specialists.</p>
									<p>Because oni are different from regular youkai, the means of extermination and the tools necessary are particular and specialized.</p>
									<p>The sorcery to exterminate oni have already been lost by humans, thus it would appear that meeting an oni nowadays would be too much for anyone to handle.</p>
									<p>In reality, the way in which things like the Tsuina ceremonies or other oni-repelling rituals are conducted are already inaccurate.</p>
									<p>But then, the chances of meeting an oni are already mostly non-existent so they should be no problems, but...</p>

									<hr>
									<p>A long time has passed since the oni disappeared from Gensokyo.</p>
									<p>However, there have been recent confirmed reports of oni sightings.</p>
									<p>Those are of Suika Ibuki.</p>
									<p><a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="This is particularly problematic given that no one knows how to exterminate oni.">She suddenly appeared in and settled down in Gensokyo for some reason.</a></p>
									<p>Her body is small, and the two long horns on her head stand out in contrast to her short stature.</p>
									<p>She may not look terribly frightening compared to other youkai, but she is an oni.</p>
									<p>She possesses enormous strength, and boasts that if she wanted to, <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="This isn't entirely impossible, given that she's an oni. And after all, oni don't lie.">she could tear down the Youkai Mountain by herself.</a></p>
									<p>A drinker without peer, she always carries around a <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="A bottomless gourd of sake.">gourd filled with sake</a>, from which she constantly imbibes.</p>
									<p>As a result, there are no reports of her behavior when sober.</p>
									<hr>
									<h4 class="text-center">Ability to Manipulate Density</h4>
									<p>This is the power to alter the density and thickness of anything.</p>
									<p>All things become a fine mist if their density lowers. Conversely, when objects are made more dense, their temperature increases so they melt.</p>
									<p>Because she loves the bustle of festivals and parties, she has the humans and youkai assemble and hold festivals.</p>
									<p>This ability to cause humans and youkai to assemble is a manifestation of her power over density.</p>
									<hr>
									<h4 class="text-center">Eyewitness Reports</h4>
									<blockquote>
										<p>She can do physical work, she collects the garbage, so I guess she is useful in a sense.</p>
										<footer>Reimu Hakurei</footer>
									</blockquote>
									<p>Just like certain tools, oni can be very useful if skillfully handled.</p>
									<p>If you can build a relationship of mutual trust with them, oni are not that fearsome.</p>
									<blockquote>
										<p>I wonder if she could help me gather unusual things.</p>
										<footer>Sakuya Izayoi</footer>
									</blockquote>
									<p>It may be dangerous to be overly frank about your desires, though.</p>
									<hr>
									<h4 class="text-center">Countermeasures</h4>
									<p>As knowledge about oni and methods of their extermination have been lost in modern times, it's best not to even attempt to destroy them.</p>
									<p>There is absolutely no chance of succeeding.</p>
									<p>However, tentatively, there are a few methods of protecting yourself from an oni.</p>
									<p>For example, you can run a holly branch through a sardine head and place it in front of the entrance to your house.</p>
									<p>It's said this will prevent an oni from coming near you, but <a class="text-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="With faith, even the head of a sardine can be a charm.">it's effectiveness is unknown.</a></p>
