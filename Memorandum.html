									<textarea readonly>Is it supposed to be this easy to get lost in a bamboo forest at night?
There's my cell phone can't get a signal here, the GPS isn't working
and there are rare natural bamboo shoots for the taking...
Maybe I'll rest around here for today... but aren't I already dreaming now?
Nothing else I can do. I'll walk around a little bit and see.

And then there is the sky filled with stars.
Whether it is the underdevelopedness or the clear skies, this place seems like Japan a long time ago.
Am I in a time slip, perhaps?
Was Hawking's reversibility of the arrow of time actually true?
If there weren't monsters around here then this place would be more fun.

That's right, could it be that the dream world is actually the memories of the substance that makes up the soul?
Monsters are the symbols of traumatic memories.

Hmm, that's a new theory.
I'm gonna tell Renko about it when I wake up.
Now then, maybe I should start wandering around again.</textarea>

							<p>There are many words with unknown meanings, so it is still undecipherable.</p>

							<p>just what is the meaning of "dream world"?</p>
